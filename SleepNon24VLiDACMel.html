                    <h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>
This is an experimental protocol for 24h entrainment of treatment-resistant sighted <a href="https://www.circadiansleepdisorders.org/docs/N24-QandA.php" title="non24" class="https">non24</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is a work-in-progress documentation of the author's self-experiment. Hence, it will continue to evolve over time. Check out later this document for updates.
</p>

<p>
As of July 2020, the protocol is considered mature, as it reproducibly allows for a stable (but not constant) entrainment of the author's circadian rhythm to a 24h cycle. Furthermore, all the observed effects could be elucidated by previous studies, which provides a framework to predict how this therapy works in various scenarios. What remains to be explored are the following points:<br>
<ul>
<li>Reproduce the shorter than 24h circadian period with very long bright blue light therapy. This would allow to adjust backwards the circadian rhythm (ie, sleep and wake up earlier) without having to freerun forward.</li>
<li>Systematization of the therapy by circadian rhythm monitoring using wearable devices. Just like diabetes became medically manageable when glucose and insulin monitoring devices could be made, there needs to be a device to monitor the circadian rhythm in order to properly time the therapies and monitor their effects as well as chaotic biological fluctuations.</li>
<li>Publication of the database of vital signs and sleep logs for this self-experiment to allow for third-party review and analyses.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The therapy protocol is 8 pages long at the moment. In addition to the therapy, there is also a TROUBLESHOOTING section towards the end of this document, which aims to answer the most common questions about the various therapies for non24 and clarify how they work and how to optimize them according to the current scientific knowledge. This section is much longer than the therapy outline, and hence it is written for the curious reader to further their knowledge and/or answer their questions about or around circadian rhythm disorders. Reading the Troubleshooting section is not mandatory, rather the reader is invited to search there in case of a specific question that is not answered in the therapy outline.
</p>

<p>
This therapy was designed to treat sighted non24. Since the tools influencing the circadian rhythm are the same for all humans (and actually most research was done on typical sleepers but are applicable for people with circadian rhythm disorders), some parts may also be applicable to DSPD with some changes (mostly that the goal of DSPD is to phase advance gradually, whereas non24 aims to freeze the circadian rhythm in place with a treatment-induced daily phase advance that counteracts the natural intrinsic daily phase delay). For ASPD, it may be possible to use the same tools too but timed at the opposite, under the phase delay part of the zeitgebers' PRCs (eg, being exposed to light therapy in the evening instead of at wake-up, as did <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3726555/" title="Czeisler et al in a case study" class="https">Czeisler et al in a case study</a>).
</p>

<p>
<b>DISCLAIMER: this protocol is not scientifically peer-reviewed and not clinically validated. It was tested on a sample size of only 2 individuals with non24 since birth and under a controlled home environment. Hence this protocol cannot be formally recommended, it should still be considered experimental and maybe risky</b> and I have yet to confirm whether all the things I did are really necessary or not, and the safety is not guaranteed. If you do try, you do it at your own risks (please ask a physician to follow you at least!).

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
I have a non24 circadian rhythm disorder, I followed a combination therapy I designed, and this is the result:
</p>

<p>
<img src="./SleepNon24VLiDACMel_files/pasted_image001.png"> 
</p>

<p>
Zoomed out, here is my full sleep diary over 1 year, with the working therapy at the end:<br>
<img src="./SleepNon24VLiDACMel_files/sleepmeter_daily_period.png" width="700">
</p>

<p>
I was entrained for 2.5 months, which is significantly much more than anything before (all previous attempts failed after 2 weeks). This was with 1-2h of light therapy at wake up.
</p>

<p>
Here is the result with very long light therapy of more than 5h everyday for 10 days, this results in an ASPD pattern, waking up 30 min earlier every day and 1h30 (one ultradian cycle) earlier the last day (which prompted the premature stopping of the self-experiment because this became uncontrollably too early):
</p>

<p>
<img src="./SleepNon24VLiDACMel_files/n24-to-aspd.png" width="500">
</p>

<p>
This experiment with very long light therapy was done after 1 more month of entrainment as can be seen. The  very long light therapy resulted in a staggering reduction of circadian period tau under 24h at 23.5h on average and 22.5h the last day! Everything else was held constant (same melatonin intake time, same meal eating time, same daytime activities and environment), only light therapy duration was extended to reduce the circadian period under 24h.
</p>

<p>
Before this working therapy, I tried: 1- melatonin only, 2- light therapy lamps + melatonin, 3- strict ketogenic diet only with timed meals (time-restricted feeding), 4- intermittent fasting (or even complete fasting for a few days), 5-carbs-only diet, and of course strict sleep hygiene, but none of those worked.
</p>

<p>
The latest working therapy protocol, which worked for 2.5 months at the time of this writing, is named <b>VLiDACMel</b>, which stands for:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>V</b>ery long <b>Li</b>ght therapy at wake-up,</li>
<li><b>D</b>ark therapy in the evening,</li>
<li><b>A</b>void <b>C</b>arbs and <b>Mel</b>atonin mixup,</li>
<li>and take exogenous instant-release <b>Mel</b>atonin timed before DLMO (measured via core body temperature or approximated via 3 days average of wake-up times).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The threshold to consider any treatment effective was set to 1 month of entrainment, entrainment being defined as an average wake-up time under 1 ultradian cycle (a time window of 1.5-2h), such as wake up between 9am and 11am.
</p>

<p>
Concisely, this therapy is founded on the following 3 points:<br>
<ul>
<li>Light exposure control: light therapy glasses Luminette at wake-up (or another light source of 500lux with optimized light angle to stimulate ipRGCs in the nasal retinal hemiregion) to phase advance and hence reduce circadian period (biological day duration). The exposure must be "very long", so use for 3-5h from wake up using relatively low intensity bright light of 500 lux. Light therapy must always be combined with dark therapy in the evening (ie, avoidance of light exposure to avoid unwanted phase delay), by using blue light filters and dimming the brightness of any light emitting device/lamps (or use blue blocker sunglasses if environmental light sources cannot be controlled).</li>
<li>Sleep induction and consolidation by melatonin: use melatonin instant release pills, taken at a time calculated relatively to the individual's DLMO. This both consolidates sleep (ie, ensures you sleep your full night and not wake up too early or in the middle of your night causing unwanted sleep deprivation) and phase advance. The effect is additive with light therapy.</li>
<li>Food timing and diet composition control: reduce/minimize carbohydrates intake, and avoid them after melatonin intake. In the experiment above, I was half the time under a strict ketogenic diet, and half under a balanced diet including carbs. The ketogenic diet is not necessary, but it can help at first before phasing it out.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Full protocol</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Preparation the two weeks before doing this new therapy: sleep without alarms to fulfill your sleeping needs, and wait for your circadian rhythm to shift naturally until it's close</li>
</ul>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
1- Sleep according to your own natural rhythm for 2 weeks. If necessary, buy an eye mask and ear plugs to prevent external factors from disrupting your sleep. This is necessary to stabilize your sleep and circadian rhythm before starting the therapy.<br>
2- Write down your wake-up time and falling asleep time every day in a journal (use Sleepmeter on Android). This will serve 2 purposes: you can get a formal diagnosis from a specialized sleep doctor with 2 weeks of sleep logs showing a non24 pattern, and it also allows you to better know what affect your sleep and better know your own sleep patterns. Indeed, it's not uncommon that we overestimate the duration of our sleep, and for non24 individuals the daily phase delay (ie, it's often shorter than you think).<br>
3- Take this opportunity to get to better listen to your body and recognize the signs of sleepiness tiredness signalling your body is ready to sleep. It takes at least 2-3 days of good sleep (good duration AND circadian alignment) for the body to recover and feel fully working. For individuals with non-24, this can be a genuinely new experience to NOT feel sleep deprived, since they only lived under sleep deprivation before. It is extremely helpful to know what it's like to not be sleep deprived, and to learn to differenciate when you are sleep deprived and when you are not, as it will help in knowing when to adjust the treatments timing and dosage for you.<br>
4- After the 2 weeks, calculate the average wake-up time over the last 3 days. Subtract the sleep duration you need to feel the most refreshed after sleep (usually 7-8h for adults) + 2 hours from this average wake-up time to compute the DLMO (dim-light melatonin onset). Example: if the average wake-up time over 3 days was 6am, and you need 7h of sleep to feel refreshed, your DLMO is at 6-7-2 = 9pm. Subtract 2-4 hours from this DLMO time to get the ideal time window to take melatonin. Using the previous example, the melatonin intake window would be between 5-7pm.<br>
5- Now, wait for your sleep to cycle and come close to the ideal time you would like to freeze in-place. Indeed, there is no proven way to cycle backward (ie, wake up earlier and earlier), but if you phase advance enough, you'll eventually reach the wake-up time you would like (this is called a phase delay chronotherapy). If you are too eager and start the therapies below out of phase with your circadian rhythm, this will not work and may worsen sleep deprivation temporarily. Start the next steps below when your wake-up time is around 2-4h before the ideal time you would like to wake up. Meanwhile, continue to write a sleep log.

</p>

<p>
Note it is critical to wait for your circadian rhythm to be in phase with the ideal timing you wish before starting the therapy, as otherwise the treatments will be mistimed and some of them such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27449476" title="light therapy can increase sleep fragmentation if mistimed" class="https">light therapy can increase sleep fragmentation if mistimed</a>.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>After the 2 weeks of natural sleep, use now this combination of therapies everyday, laid out here in chronological order of use during the day, and the major steps emboldened:
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li><b>Very long light therapy: use 500 lux bright light therapy at wake-up for 2-4h with an angle towards your nose to "freeze" your circadian rhythm by constant phase advance or even reduce circadian period to less than 24h. Also stops melatonin production and increases vigilance and mood. This is the strongest tool to manipulate the circadian rhythm.</b> Use light therapy glasses such as Luminette for 2-4h directly as soon as you wake up. If you are in a dimly lit environment, start with the eyes closed for a few seconds to allow for the eyes pupils to contract, before opening your eyes for the rest of the session. The longer the exposure, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-44035-3" title="proportionally" class="https">proportionally</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2371371" title="more" class="https">more</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29707782/" title="phase advance" class="https">phase advance</a> you will get. It's possible to increase the duration of exposure to more than 5h, in which case you will wake up earlier and earlier (but be careful because <b>the effect increases over time, being maximal at 10 days</b>, so you may quickly end up waking up too early!). The lowest setting, 500 lux, is sufficient with the Luminette. Increasing the intensity is not necessary and I did not notice a significantly greater phase advance (contrary to longer exposure), likely because <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3892948/" title="light intensity has a lower saturation point than duration" class="https">light intensity has a lower saturation point than duration</a>. Longer exposure will be necessary depending on age, as <a href="https://www.anses.fr/fr/system/files/AP2014SA0253Ra.pdf" title="the eyes lens (cristallin) are obscuring and acting as a blue-light filter with age" class="https">the eyes lens (cristallin) are obscuring and acting as a blue-light filter with age</a> (see also <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11818-019-00215-x" title="here" class="https">here</a>), although <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311830" title="only melatonin inhibition is impaired by age but not the circadian phase advance which remains the same" class="https">only melatonin inhibition is impaired by age but not the circadian phase advance which remains the same</a>.
<ul>
<li>If you want a cheaper alternative to the Luminette, any bright light should be sufficient to get some phase advance, although it will be less effective and reliable than the Luminette since it's enriched with blue light and it's very ergonomic with a precise and constant distance to the eyes. A computer screen at max brightness can be sufficient (if it emits at least 100 lux, this can be tested with a lux meter app on any smartphone). Several users reported success with various DIY devices, such as make-up mirror lights, strong neon lights or with a cheap $30 Beurer TL30 lamp. Just ensure the light is close enough to your eyes to get enough lux (at least 1000 lux if white light, or 500 lux if blue enriched). The light source also needs to be oriented in the peripheral view as to target either <a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/76/16/1422" title="the parafoveal or nasal region of the retina" class="https">the parafoveal or nasal region of the retina</a> as these regions much <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10194647/" title="more effectively suppress melatonin" class="https">more effectively suppress melatonin</a>.</li>
<li>Bright light therapy is even more important if you use more than 1mg of melatonin (supraphisiological levels), because there will be residually higher levels of melatonin next morning that will cause drowsiness, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6928018/" title="bright light therapy can forcefully inhibit that" class="https">bright light therapy can forcefully inhibit that</a>.</li>
<li>Light is likely the most powerful tool we have to control the circadian rhythm, as it was shown in animals that <a href="https://www.theses.fr/2012STRAJ094" title="light can entrain even without a pacemaker" class="https">light can entrain even without a pacemaker</a>.</li>
<li>Light also <a href="https://www.psio.com/pdf/pro/How-to-increase-serotonin-in-the-human-brain.pdf" title="increases serotonin levels and hence vigilance," class="https">increases serotonin levels and hence vigilance,</a> particularly <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0748730416657462" title="at wake-up when sleep inertia is at its highest" class="https">at wake-up when sleep inertia is at its highest</a>, since <a href="https://www.theses.fr/2012STRAJ094" title="light impacts both the circadian rhythm C and the homeostatic (sleep pressure) process S" class="https">light impacts both the circadian rhythm C and the homeostatic (sleep pressure) process S</a> (which makes sense since <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aba0769" title="cordycepin" class="https">cordycepin</a>, an adenosine analog and adenosine being the biological basis of the homeostatic process S, has a huge impact on the circadian rhythm C, showing that both processes are inter-dependent).

<li>During the rest of the day, after the wake-up light therapy, it is advisable to continue to be exposed to bright light throughout the rest of your natural day, in order to optimize photic history, as it was shown that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29707782/" title="6h of bright light exposure (whether continuous or intermittent) shifts the circadian phase way more" class="https">6h of bright light exposure (whether continuous or intermittent) shifts the circadian phase way more</a> than only 1h of light exposure, and with continuous light suppressing melatonin more than pulsed light (hence continuous light is likely more efficient to increase vigilance).

</ul>
</li>
<li>Timed big main meal, which is to take your main meal at the middle of your circadian rythm's day. This synchronizes your circadian rhythm thanks to your intestines regulation of the circadian clocks (it's the biggest producer of melatonin). You can eat a breakfast, but it should be relatively small, and there should be only one big meal during the day (eg, the sort of meal that you feel like you ate enough for the whole rest of the day - but be careful of not over-eating!). More than entraining your circadian rhythm, timing meals allows to avoid circadian misalignment, as eating food during your biological night or too close to it can impair several regulatory functions such as insulin and glucose. This is true not only for non24 and DSPD but also for typical sleepers as well, although the former may be even more at risk due to a mutation in melatonin type 2 receptor (MT2) which seems to be more prevalent in individuals with a circadian rhythm disorder.
<ul>
<li>DEPRECATED: not necessary (but can be hepful): Follow a strict ketogenic diet with timed big main meal. The effects will start only after you reach the highest 2 levels on the ketostix (measurements of ketosis from urine): Reduce the quantity of consumed carbohydrates, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26084345/" title="as each 1% reduction improves the metabolism and reduces risks of obesity and metabolic disorders, including sleep" class="https">as each 1% reduction improves the metabolism and reduces risks of obesity and metabolic disorders, including sleep</a>. Following a strict ketogenic diet is kind of the extreme of this strategy, which has the additional advantage of reducing the sleep duration (by one ultradian cycle, so about 1h30-2h) while improving sleep quality (so there is no loss in sleep even if the duration is smaller, which eases the maintenance of a stable sleep), reduce hunger (eases the avoidance of the detrimental melatonin/insulin/carbs interaction in the evening) and increases the time resetting effect of food (by increasing the intestines time clock gene expression and switching off liver's time clock genes and melatonin production - in other words your peripheral circadian clocks will rely more on your food timing, which is a lot easier to control than other zeitgebers). A strict ketogenic diet is a diet with &lt;=50g of wet carbs (sugar+fibers), including &lt;= 20g of sugar carbs per day. This can be tested with a simple urine test using the ketostix. Note that a ketogenic is mostly composed of fat, and only mildly with proteins, do not compensate for the lack of carbs by eating too much proteins, as they will get converted to carbs, preventing you from reaching the highest levels of ketosis as indicated by the last 2 colors on the ketostix. If you choose to do a ketogenic diet, plan to start it ahead, at least 2 weeks before the rest of this protocol, as to have enough time for your sleep to adapt and stabilize with the new diet. Also make sure to use vitamins and minerals complement to avoid the risk of electrolytes insuffisance contributing to the dreaded keto flu. The most effective version of my therapy was with a strict ketogenic diet, so you should probably try that at first and if this works you can then try to transition back to a more complete diet with carbs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Kickstart your melatonin production with a melatonin pill and hence sleep and help its consolidation</b>: take melatonin in instant release form (the dosage is not important, can be as low as <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/86/10/4727/2849013" title="0.1mg" class="https">0.1mg</a> or up to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/95/7/3325/2596406" title="3mg" class="https">3mg</a>, but only doses &gt; 1mg can <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14715839/" title="produce hypothermia" class="https">produce hypothermia</a> as also shown <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/86/10/4727/2849013" title="here" class="https">here</a> and hence greater phase advancing effects). What also matters is that it dissolves in sublingual instantly - if you can't find an immediate/fast release melatonin, you can use long/prolonged release melatonin but <a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/melatonin.html" title="crushed" class="https">crushed</a> to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5108473/" title="avoid the coating (parent compound) from delaying the melatonin intake" class="https">avoid the coating (parent compound) from delaying the melatonin intake</a>) during the ideal melatonin window time you calculated before. Melatonin not only helps with phase advance, but also consolidates the 2nd part of your sleep, so you are more likely to sleep your full night rather than be woken up earlier because of various disturbances.</li>
<li><b>No food nor caloric drink past melatonin intake time, to prevent food/glucose from interacting with melatonin</b>: after you take melatonin or when it's too late and you think melatonin is produced by your body, do NOT eat any glucose, and if possible any calories at all. But 0% drinks are allowed. Research has shown that glucose is processed worse when melatonin is present in the body, which can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6851668/" title="lead to metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes" class="https">lead to metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes</a>, and we suspect circadian rhythm disorders.

<ul>
<li>The author strongly recommends the UVEX glasses with SCT-Orange coating as blue light filters, they are very inexpensive and highly effective. Use the UVEX Skyper if you want to hang outside with it, or the UVEX S0360X Ultra Spec if you want to use prescription glasses under, as the Ultra-Spec are big enough to fit prescription glasses under, but not the Skyper.</li>
<li>For reliable dimming in uncontrollable environment (eg, outside your home), a blue blocker SUNglasses such as UVEX amber glasses and manually tinted in black using VLT shading films for cars windows is a very easy way to do both dimming and blue light filtering in any environment without any hassle.</li>
<li>If you don't have access to such glasses, a more inconvenient and less reliable but working alternative is to modify the environment: dim down / switch off all lamps (including your computer screen intensity) and install blue light filters softwares on your computer (advised: LightBulb or f.lux) and smartphone (Twilight on Android). If you have a changing color LED lamp (eg, Living Colors), use it as a bed lamp by setting it to full red color (the blue LED should be switched off if you selected an appropriately full red color).</li>
<li>Why start the dark therapy 2-4h before target bedtime? Because melatonin takes 1-2h to produce drowsiness effects from its DLMO point, and it takes 1-2h for melatonin production to reach it's DLMO level from the moment it starts its production (or from when the light inhibition/exposure is stopped). Hence, the dark therapy should be started 2-4h before the natural bedtime. Whereas light therapy phase advances your circadian rhythm (ie, you wake up earlier), dark therapy prevents unwanted phase delays due to light exposure, which concretely makes you feel more fatigued at the wanted time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Optimize sleep preparations and hygiene:
<ul>
<li><b>Use an eye mask and ear plugs (or a white/pink noise machine) to reduce the highly detrimental effect of noise and disturbances on your sleep efficiency</b>. This is NOT optional, having any disturbance during your sleep will annihilate any effort you can undertake otherwise! An inexpensive silk black eye mask will do, and outer earplugs in silicon are advised as they are much more comfortable than inner earplugs (they reduce the proliferation of bacteria and hence itchy ears).</li>
<li>Mind the ultradian cycles (20 minutes "gates to sleep" every 1h30) and the dopaminergic <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30030487" title="forbidden zone of sleeping" class="https">forbidden zone of sleeping</a></li>
<li>If you can't sleep (eg, missed the ultradian cycle window), then wake up or sit and do something else than trying to sleep until the next window to sleep.</li>
<li>Identify any factor that can impair your sleep and buy the necessary workarounds. Anything that can prevent disturbances on your sleep is well worth it. If it's too warm temperature, buy a fan. If it's mosquitos, buy an anti-mosquito net for beds and/or a anti-mosquito lamp.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Optional but strongly advised: take multivitamins and minerals, including B12 and magnesium supplementation every morning. B12 vitamin is known to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8698113/" title="amplify the magnitude of the circadian rhythm shift of light therapies" class="https">amplify the magnitude of the circadian rhythm shift of light therapies</a> (see also <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8842380/" title="here" class="https">here</a>) and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2305167/" title="B12 supplementation entrained a few individuals with non24" class="https">B12 supplementation entrained a few individuals with non24</a> (see also <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1759094/" title="here" class="https">here</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6622881/" title="here" class="https">here</a>). <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-difference-between-melatonin-magnesium-in-terms-of-how-each-supplement-helps-you-sleep-15644629" title="Magnesium also affects the circadian rhythm" class="https">Magnesium also affects the circadian rhythm</a> (studies <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160413135707.htm" title="here" class="https">here</a> and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature17407" title="here" class="http">here</a>). <a href="https://thesleepdoctor.com/2019/02/12/5-vitamin-deficiencies-that-can-affect-your-sleep/" title="Vitamin D deficiencies can affect the circadian rhythm" class="https">Vitamin D deficiencies can affect the circadian rhythm</a> and <a href="https://www.vitamindcouncil.org/new-research-finds-activated-vitamin-d-regulates-genes-involved-in-the-circadian-rhythm/#.XFDSQS2ZPow" title="it interacts with at least 2 clock genes" class="https">it interacts with at least 2 clock genes</a>. <a href="https://synapse.koreamed.org/search.php?where=aview&id=10.4162/nrp.2011.5.3.230&code=0161NRP&vmode=FULL" title="Vitamin B6 helps with serotonin and melatonin production" class="https">Vitamin B6 helps with serotonin and melatonin production</a>. Supplements are not going to fix your circadian rhythm, but deficiencies can have a detrimental effect on it, although it's not always a fix as shown by the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9413873/" title="ineffectiveness of B12 in a placebo controlled trial on DSPD" class="https">ineffectiveness of B12 in a placebo controlled trial on DSPD</a>.

Furthermore, deficiencies in other vitamins and minerals may impact mood (eg, magnesium), neurology (eg, vitamin B6, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31094486" title="B12" class="https">B12</a>) and the circadian rhythm (magnesium and B12), so by taking a multivitamins and minerals supplementation you eliminate these potential factors on your sleep easily. Plus, if you do a strict ketogenic diet, this supplementation will help avoid electrolytes imbalance (but you may also need to supplement in salt). For B12 supplementation, use <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/methylcobalamin-vs-cyanocobalamin#bottom-line" title="cyanocobalamin form, as it can be converted by the body into both forms of B12" class="https">cyanocobalamin form, as it can be converted by the body into both forms of B12</a> (methylcobalamin or adenosylcobalamin). Some Discord users with diagnosed chronic B12 deficiencies influencing their circadian rhythm reported the B12 shots are more effective than the pills.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Continue this combination of therapy strictly (respect the hours and use melatonin and light therapy everyday!) for at least 10 days. Indeed, because of carry-over effects such as <b>photic history</b> and <b>gut microbiota adaptation</b>, it takes several days to a few weeks for the body to adapt to both light and dietary (including melatonin) changes. This means that when starting a circadian rhythm therapy, it will take about 10 days for the full effects to be seen, and it will take as much time when stopping the therapy for the effects to wear off. But you should already see some effects a few days in, such as mood and vigilance boost from the first use of light therapy, and some circadian rhythm phase advance after 2 days of light therapy.
</p>

<p>
In practice, the first week you should see a reduction of your phase delay, and the next week your circadian rhythm (in particular your wake-up time) should be somewhat stable, and it will get more stable along time as you continue with the therapy. The time windows need to be respected, but a slight change of +-30min from day to day is OK in my experience (eg, taking melatonin 30min later or earlier, and there is more room for food timing as long as you do not eat past the melatonin intake time).
</p>

<p>
Disclaimer: I thorougly designed and tested this protocol on myself after several failed variations. I do not guarantee that this protocol will work for you, or that all steps are necessary, but I tried to test as many variations as I could by eliminating or changing some steps, and this is the only combination that worked so far, so keep that in mind if you partially try this protocol, if you skip some steps this may reduce the effectiveness (or not work at all). But even if you follow all steps, this may not work for you either. I share this protocol because it should be safe to try and because it was highly effective for me, so I believe it may work for other non24ers with the same etiology (genetic mutation of MT2 receptor?) as I have.

<h2>TROUBLESHOOTING</h2>

<p>
This section aims to answer several common and less common but crucial questions about circadian rhythm disorders and the potential treatments. The content in this section aims to be a short version of the most crucial details I have accumulated in <a href="" title="my more complete 200+ page document" class="page">my more complete 200+ page document</a>, which you can read if you would like further information or details.
</p>

<p>
There are two kinds of solutions usually: either change your environment, or wear gadgets to isolate from the environment. This guide focuses on wearables, because although the results may be similar, wearables are much more comfortable and controllable, and hence more reliable than modifying the environment. Indeed, it's much easier to just put on your light therapy glasses and do your things such as preparing yourself for work, than standing in front of a light therapy lamp for 1-3h without doing anything else. You can even bring your light therapy glasses to work if you don't have enough time beforehand.
</p>

<p>
Also, wearables are a lot less expensive than older solutions. A proper light therapy setup used to cost thousands of dollars to get enough lux (most cheap lamps don't provide enough lux unless you are literally on the nose with the lamp). Nowadays, light therapy glasses cost only $100-200. For other things such as dark therapy, blue blocker glasses cost only $10. That's why for example we prefer an eye mask and ear plugs instead of using cardboard on the window and soundproofing the walls. We also prefer using blue blocker sunglasses and light therapy glasses such as Luminette instead of advising to buy bright light neon fixtures that you'll need to setup up all around your house at the correct orientation for you or to go outside for a walk early in the morning: it's far easier to just put some glasses on your nose when your alarm rings.

<h3>General informations about the non24 disorder</h3>

<br>

<h4>What is the non24 sleep-wake circadian rhythm disorder?</h4>

<p>
Non24 is a severe circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder. It is a very disabling, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26568125/" title="debilitating disease characterized by an inability to sleep and wake up on a 24-hour schedule" class="https">debilitating disease characterized by an inability to sleep and wake up on a 24-hour schedule</a>, and which impacts not only sleep but also <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0269881119855343" title="wakefulness" class="https">wakefulness</a>. Indeed, if untreated, this disorder produces constant sleep deprivation which compounds with circadian misalignment, which causes near constant brain fog, reduced cognitive abilities, slower reaction time and health issues such as cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity. This is in addition to the social exclusion directly caused by this special schedule. This worsen comorbid organic and mental disorders such as autism, adhd and depression.
</p>

<p>
Although non24 indeed includes a necessary and unpreventable freerunning without non behavioral treatments, the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0269881119855343" title="sleeping pattern can be highly variable and unpredictable from day to day" class="https">sleeping pattern can be highly variable and unpredictable from day to day</a> even in the absence of external disturbances, as sleep bouts can happen at random unexpected times, as well as experiencing premature wake ups.
</p>

<p>
Non24 and other circadian rhythm disorders are invisible diseases, with <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/8967-quit-your-sleep-shaming-america" title="sleep-shaming being a common occurrence" class="https">sleep-shaming being a common occurrence</a>. Sleep shaming is due to the general public's misconceptions about how sleep works, which is not specific to sleep disorders but also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightshift/comments/hjmron/sleepshaming/" title="affects typical sleepers doing night shifts" class="https">affects typical sleepers doing night shifts</a>. More generally, the general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism" title="ableism culture" class="https">ableism culture</a> does not help with the recognition of chronic diseases.
</p>

<p>
Often, non-24 is a multifactorial and complex disorder, which means that it is suspected to be in a similar class of disorders as autism, where multiple causes can lead to developing a non-24 disorder. This is also hinted at by the fact that some individuals are born with the disorder, such as the author of this document, while others seem to develop it later in life (although this may be due to misdiagnosis in childhood).
</p>

<h4>Are circadian rhythm disorders real diseases and disabilities?</h4>

<p>
Organic vs non-organic in DSM, recognized and billable in ICD-10
</p>

<p>
Decreases cognitive performance and alertness (can be dangerous).
</p>

<p>
Need accomodations and can get them where ICD-10 or DSM is recognized and used for billing.
</p>

<p>
TODO: update the above using: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/h8tnco/does_it_make_sense_to_try_to_get_a_diagnosis/" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/h8tnco/does_it_make_sense_to_try_to_get_a_diagnosis/" class="https">https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/h8tnco/does_it_make_sense_to_try_to_get_a_diagnosis/</a>
</p>

<p>
Smart business owners with wide office hours (ie, night shift) or where teleworking is possible could <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/53890-daylight-savings-time-effects-on-health-circadian-rhythm" title="flexibly organize employees schedules based on their circadian alignment to optimize production" class="https">flexibly organize employees schedules based on their circadian alignment to optimize production</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11583769/" title="reduce work accidents" class="https">reduce work accidents</a>. Indeed, morning larks perform badly and lack attention in the evening or worse at night, whereas night owls perform better in the evening and DSPDs during the night. Hence, with some societal recognition and work culture evolutions, the variety of chronotypes could be leveraged to ensure optimal work conditions and productivity in our already 24/7 society.
</p>

<p>
However, individuals with non24 would still not fit. Indeed, there are only a handful of jobs where a constantly shifting schedule would be an advantage, such as NASA's Mars monitoring missions which require ideally a martian schedule of 24.6h, and maybe healthcare with an adapted rotating schedule with smaller increments.
</p>

</p>

<h4>Sleep diary and diagnosis</h4>

<p>
Making a sleep log is the most useful thing someone with a sleep disorder can do. I strongly recommend to write a sleep log of when you fall asleep and when you wake up, for <a href="https://aasm.org/resources/clinicalguidelines/crswd-intrinsic.pdf" title="at least 2 weeks" class="https">at least 2 weeks</a> but preferably longer. This sleep log (aka sleep diary) will not only be <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0269881119855343" title="helpful to you to better understand your sleep patterns" class="https">helpful to you to better understand your sleep patterns</a> (ie, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31256786" title="determine the circadian misalignment" class="https">determine the circadian misalignment</a>), but also <a href="https://aasm.org/resources/clinicalguidelines/crswd-intrinsic.pdf" title="can be used for diagnosis with a sleep specialist" class="https">can be used for diagnosis with a sleep specialist</a> according to the official <a href="https://aasm.org/resources/clinicalguidelines/crswd-intrinsic.pdf" title="USA" class="https">USA</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0269881119855343" title="UK guidelines" class="https">UK guidelines</a> (<a href="http://sleepeducation.org/docs/default-document-library/crswd-draft-executive-summary.pdf?sfvrsn=2" title="executive summary here" class="http">executive summary here</a>) and also is <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11818-019-00215-x" title="necessary to correctly time the only few treatment options" class="https">necessary to correctly time the only few treatment options</a> (see also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31256786" title="here" class="https">here</a>) that exist currently.
</p>

<p>
I strongly advise the app Sleepmeter Free on Android and its widget to write a digital sleep log which will produce nice charts that are easier for humans to read. It can also be installed on a computer using the Bluestacks emulator.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29991437/" title="actigraphy can be used for diagnosis" class="https">actigraphy can be used for diagnosis</a>, although this does not replace a sleep diary. In the clinical setting, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31256786" title="DLMO salivatory sampling is the gold standard" class="https">DLMO salivatory sampling is the gold standard</a>, but it is unfortunately <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11818-019-00215-x" title="seldom used due to constraints and cost" class="https">seldom used due to constraints and cost</a>, most clinics not being equipped to do that and this procedure not being reimbursed by health insurances in most European countries.
</p>

<p>
If the doctors you met shrugged off the sleep diary, that's a clear sign they are not properly trained to diagnose circadian rhythm disorders, as sleep diaries over at least 2 weeks are the primary way to diagnose circadian rhythm disorders according to <a href="https://aasm.org/resources/clinicalguidelines/crswd-intrinsic.pdf" title="american" class="https">american</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0269881119855343" title="british guidelines" class="https">british guidelines</a> on circadian rhythm disorders diagnosis.  In other words, handing over your sleep diary should be sufficient for any properly trained sleep specialist to diagnose you if you have a circadian rhythm disorder.
</p>

<p>
If that happened to you, this is unfortunate, but don't despair. Just try to find a doctor <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2008.00721.x" title="properly trained in circadian rhythm disorders" class="https">properly trained in circadian rhythm disorders</a>. You can check out this list compiled by the Circadian Sleep Disorders Network from recommendations by previously diagnosed DSPD and non-24 patients:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.circadiansleepdisorders.org/doctors.php" title="https://www.circadiansleepdisorders.org/doctors.php" class="https">https://www.circadiansleepdisorders.org/doctors.php</a>
</p>

<p>
If you find a good doctor who diagnose you and isn't on this list please send <a href="mailto:doctors@csd-n.org" title="the Circadian Sleep Disorders Network association an email" class="mailto">the Circadian Sleep Disorders Network association an email</a> to add your doctor in the list, this will help your future peers.
</p>

<p>
Also, if you find a properly trained doctor who successfully diagnose you, make sure to ask them to write down a description of your diagnosis, this will help later on to continue to get your treatment (eg, melatonin) if your doctor goes out of business and you need to find someone else, or to get work/school accomodations.
</p>

<h4>Health issues of a circadian rhythm disorder</h4>

<p>
Why modify your circadian rhythm? What are the health costs of free-running, circadian misalignment or chronic sleep deprivation?
</p>

<p>
The primary issue with having a circadian rhythm disorder is of course the huge chronic sleep deprivation that is constantly induced by the social jetlag (ie, the attempts to constraints to social expectations/requirements for work, family, hobbies, etc). Chronic sleep deprivation is a major health issue, not only for circadian rhythm disorders as most people are sleep deprived, although not to the extent that individuals with a circadian rhythm disorder experience. No need to go into details, you can find plenty of resources detailing how <a href="https://www.klova.com/blogs/the-daily-snooze/25-terrifying-side-effects-of-sleep-deprivation" title="harmful and dangerous sleep deprivation" class="https">harmful and dangerous sleep deprivation</a> is, one of the rare disorders that can directly cause death.
</p>

<p>
Note that being often ill may be a strong sign of chronic sleep deprivation.

Sleep deprivation can either be fixed by free-running or by being entrained, the latter being very difficult if not impossible to reach for most non24 at this stage of scientific knowledge. So is free-running enough to live heathily? Unfortunately, that's unlikely.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, free-running means that there is an almost constant <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4677771/" title="circadian misalignment" class="https">circadian misalignment</a> (ie, misalignment between the individual's circadian rhythm and the day/night cycle). But the production of some hormones, such as melatonin, is dependent on the external day/night cycle. Melatonin is produced most at night, as it is inhibited by bright light. Hence, a free-running individual is likely to have reduced levels of melatonin due to unwanted inhibition by light exposure.
</p>

<p>
What are the consequences of melatonin reduction? Well, melatonin is a strong (maybe the strongest) anti-oxydant in the body. It is also immunomodulatory. Hence, a lack of melatonin is linked in animal models with various diseases and immunodepression.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, mistimed eating when melatonin is at high levels in the body has been linked with metabolic dysregulations, and even directly caused diabetes in an animal model, without any other change of any other factor. Hence, both the lack of melatonin and the mistiming of melatonin with other factors such as food can produce detrimental effects on health, whether or not the individual is sleeping enough by free-running. (But of course these risks are far lower than what chronic sleep deprivation causes, so health-wise it's preferable to freerun rather than suffer from sleep deprivation, but it's also preferable to be entrained than to freerun, if of course an efficient treatment is possible for the individual).
</p>

<p>
Hence, supplementation of melatonin serves two purposes: to both supplement to overcome the lack of melatonin, and help with entrainment which directly reduces unwanted inhibition of melatonin by light.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the potential health issues of free-running non-24 or DSPD sleeping according to their natural schedule remain unexplored by the medical science. But we do have indirect evidence from extrinsic circadian rhythm disorders, such as night shift disorder, which is much more common. We can define 3 different broad classes of health risks related to circadian rhythm disorders:<br>
<ul>
<li>Sleep deprivation, usually chronic (ie, regularly experienced). Sleep deprivation happens when not sleeping enough, and it becomes "chronic" when it happens regularly. <a href="https://books.google.be/books?hl=fr&lr=&id=3bVTAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT39&dq=,+eds+(2006)+Sleep+disorders+and+sleep+deprivation:+an+unmet+public+health+problem,+Extent+and+health+consequences+of+chronic+sleep+loss+and+sleep+disorders+(National+Academies+of+Science,+Washington,+DC),+pp+67%E2%80%93166.&ots=juvUnhkYPn&sig=XcXywcJJoFl8O_Vk4H3eZLcnaEg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false" title="Sleep deprivation not only has major impacts on health" class="https">Sleep deprivation not only has major impacts on health</a> that can even lead to sudden death, it can also <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/abs/10.7326/0003-4819-153-7-201010050-00006" title="curb the benefits of diet or lifestyle changes" class="https">curb the benefits of diet or lifestyle changes</a>. Hence, fixing sleep deprivation should be a primary target for general health improvement.</li>
<li>Circadian misalignment. This is when you sleep the duration you need, but outside of your biological night. The detrimental health effects is well known and experimented worldwide every year because of daylight saving timezone changes, causing <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/53890-daylight-savings-time-effects-on-health-circadian-rhythm" title="an increase of 8% in strokes, an increase of depression disorders and of car accidents" class="https">an increase of 8% in strokes, an increase of depression disorders and of car accidents</a> due to decreased vigilance.

<p>
The strongest and most direct evidence that melatonin supplementation can reduce health issues due to circadian misalignment and chronic sleep deprivation is from <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.049" title="a landmark 2020 study" class="http">a landmark 2020 study</a> (and its awesome <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092867420305559#mmc2" title="video abstract" class="https">video abstract</a>).

Contrary to what was assumed before, it's not the brain, but the accumulation of reactive oxidative species (ROS) in the guts that cause death. By supplementing orally with melatonin to flies and rats who were prevented from sleeping, they could live a full life with no behavioral sign of brain injuries. Three compounds shown effectiveness, with melatonin showing the most. If this result translates to humans, this may be a potential way to live without sleeping.

<h4>How to monitor my entrainment progress?</h4>

<p>
One of the most difficult things for someone with a non-24 circadian rhythm disorder is to find when their biological night is, as it changes all the time and somewhat chaotically.
</p>

<p>
To see if your circadian rhythm is stabilizing to a constant time, or just to find where your biological night is when freerunning, it is possible to use your sleep diary. But do not monitor your <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15600132" title="bedtime nor your falling asleep time (sleep onset), as they are both unreliable markers of the circadian rhythm" class="https">bedtime nor your falling asleep time (sleep onset), as they are both unreliable markers of the circadian rhythm</a>. This was demonstrated on both typical sleepers and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27611743/" title="DSPD" class="https">DSPD</a>. In other words, you can sleep more or less late with more or less variation while your circadian rhythm stays stabilized - the opposite is true, your bedtime can be regular but your circadian rhythm can still freeruns.
</p>

<p>
A much better measure is your <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15600132" title="wake up time (sleep offset), which is correlated with the DLMO and is hence a much better marker of the circadian rhythm" class="https">wake up time (sleep offset), which is correlated with the DLMO and is hence a much better marker of the circadian rhythm</a>. In other words, if your wake up time stays constant, this is a strong indication that you are stabilized.
</p>

<p>
But the wake up time can sometimes be variable due to the random occurrence of "weird insomnia" (likely <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2869.1992.tb00019.x" title="biphasic sleep" class="https">biphasic sleep</a>) or external disturbances. An even better circadian rhythm marker is the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15600132" title="midpoint of the sleep period(s)" class="https">midpoint of the sleep period(s)</a>. This was also demonstrated in both typical sleepers and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27611743/" title="DSPD" class="https">DSPD</a>.<br>
Let's say you usually sleep at 1.30am and wake up at 9.30am. The midpoint is the sleep onset time + average of (sleep onset/falling asleep - sleep offset/wake up) divided by 2 = 1.5+((9.5-1)/2) = 5.75 = 5.45am .<br>
Let's now say that the next night, you experience a biphasic sleep, so you sleep earlier at midnight but wake up at 5am and then sleep again between 9am and 11.30am. If we look only at the wake up time, it looks like you woke up 2h later than usual, but if we calculate the midpoint, we get: 0 + (11.5-0)/2 = 5.75 = 5.45am . This is exactly the same midpoint time as usual, so in fact even if the sleep was biphasic, the circadian rhythm did not change, and you will likely be able to sleep at the same time as usual on the next night.
</p>

<p>
There are also a few other signs you may indicate that you are sleeping under your biological night:<br>
<ul>
<li>if your sleep onset latency is reduced, ie, when you get to bed, you fall asleep faster than usual. In my case, I used to never take less than 30 min to fall asleep, usually it took 1 or more hours, but after entrainment it consistently took me less than 15 min, and usually under 5-10 min, to fall asleep from getting to sleep.
<ul>
<li>Tip: If it takes longer to fall asleep, either you are not sleeping in your biological night, or you missed the ultradian cycle window and need to wait for the next one (see below the ultradian cycle section). Accumulated sleep deprivation (eg, pulling an all-nighter) can also make it more difficult to sleep because of dopamine build-up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if you wake up on your own without an alarm or disturbance but didn't sleep long, then it's likely you are not sleeping in your biological night, but are rather doing a nap. <b>Duration, along with the wake up time, is a very good indicator of sleeping inside one's own biological night.</b>
<ul>
<li>How long is a normal night of sleep? The duration changes for each individual and for different ages. Most 30-60 years old adults need on average 6.5h to 10h of sleep, with less sleep needed over time. The average duration of sleep by age is quite well defined thanks to nation-wide epidemiological data.</li>
<li><img src="./SleepNon24VLiDACMel_files/pasted_image004.png" width="500"></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if your hunger and stools are more or less at the same time every day, that's a good sign your digestive system adapted to the entrainment. Since the digestive system is responsible for most melatonin production, this is certainly an important factor.</li>
<li>if you experience brain fog (aka performance reduction or sleep inertia), try to use light therapy, particularly blue light which is more effective at reducing brain fog and increasing vigilance. This should clear up the brain fog under 30min to 1h of blue light therapy, as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27449476" title="brain fog is likely due to melatonin residues in the blood stream" class="https">brain fog is likely due to melatonin residues in the blood stream</a>, which can be inhibited most effectively by blue light. If the brain fog sustains all day long, then it may be a sign of circadian misalignment (ie, sleeping all your needed hours but outside of your biological circadian night). Note also that even under entrainment, it may take a few weeks before the all day brain fog disappears, the time for the digestive system to adapt (since it is the major producer of melatonin).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In the future, it may become possible to more precisely monitor our circadian rhythm with the help of wearable core body temperature sensors.
</p>

<h4>Circadian rhythm disorders: body, brain or mental disorders?</h4>

<p>
Although there is a common misconception that circadian rhythm disorders are either neurological or psychological (as reflected in the DSM and ICD-10 classifications TODO: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/h8tnco/does_it_make_sense_to_try_to_get_a_diagnosis/" title="update with precise classif G vs F" class="https">update with precise classif G vs F</a>), hence stemming from dysregulations in the brain or thoughts, this can only be qualified as incorrect.
</p>

<p>
Let's tackle this question step-by-step.
</p>

<h5>Can circadian rhythm disorders be psychologically caused or manipulated?</h5>

<p>
Although almost <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/4.1.1" title="all humans have a naturally non-24 circadian clock" class="https">all humans have a naturally non-24 circadian clock</a> (~<a href="https://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih_sleep_curr-supp.pdf" title="24.2h according to the NIH" class="https">24.2h according to the NIH</a>), and hence can freerun in the absence of external time cues, as shown by the "<a href="https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Siffre" title="expériences hors du temps" class="https">expériences hors du temps</a>" done by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/24/us/after-130-days-of-cave-life-a-return-to-glare-of-the-sun.html" title="several speleologists" class="https">several speleologists</a> or the modern variants of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30030487/" title="forced desynchrony protocol or nap paradigms" class="https">forced desynchrony protocol or nap paradigms</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4677771/" title="not everyone can follow a non-24h schedule" class="https">not everyone can follow a non-24h schedule</a>, with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20882266" title="morning larks having the most difficulties to adapt to other schedules" class="https">morning larks having the most difficulties to adapt to other schedules</a> (see also <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2014.00277/full" title="here" class="https">here</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542884" title="here" class="https">here</a>). And even when individuals can follow a non-24h schedule, it is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23024441" title="not a painless experience" class="https">not a painless experience</a> (see also <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100031099.pdf" title="here" class="https">here</a>). Work schedule experiments on the NASA crews monitoring Mars mission, where the trained crew was tasked with following a non-24h martian sleep-wake schedule to better monitor the robotic missions, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23024441" title="ended up with the crew rebelling and dropping the schedule as they felt it was unbearable (&quot;broken&quot;)" class="https">ended up with the crew rebelling and dropping the schedule as they felt it was unbearable ("broken")</a>, after a single month! As the authors noted:
</p>

<p>
&gt; The authors attributed this result to the high motivation of the crew, although motivation has limited ability to override circadian and homeostatic regulation of alertness and performance and is, in fact, subject to these influences itself.
</p>

<p>
Hence, the non24 circadian rhythm sleep wake disorder is characterized not only by a freerunning sleeping pattern, but by the fact that it is unpreventable and incontrollable (ie, no obvious and easy to fix cause). Just as any other humans, the circadian rhythm cannot be overriden simply by motivation.
</p>

<p>
Psychologically changing one's circadian rhythm is different from forcing oneself to sleep out of phase (ie, constaint the sleep schedule, in other words circadian misalignment). All individuals with non24 do constraint their sleep schedule at some point and sleep under a circadian misaligned time. In <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28364473/" title="a study" class="https">a study</a> on a cohort of individuals with DSPD which monitoring melatonin levels through salivary samples, the researchers found that half of the individuals did not in fact have a delayed melatonin profile: they were <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28364473/" title="behavioral DSPD, but not circadian DSPD" class="https">behavioral DSPD, but not circadian DSPD</a>. But without changing the circadian rhythm, this only leads to a circadian misaligned night of sleep, sleeping outside of one's biological night, which causes a short and subquality sleep accumulating sleep deprivation if reproduced repeatedly, as is shown by the fact that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28364473/" title="depression was more prevalent with the circadian DSPDs" class="https">depression was more prevalent with the circadian DSPDs</a>, and other health issues as described in another section above. Likely, the behavioral DSPD did not sleep optimally when their night was delayed later, whereas circadian DSPD consistently report that their sleep deprivation subsides as well as various other health and cognitive improvements when they sleep under their biological delayed night.
</p>

<p>
If we reduce the assumption of a psychological cause, but simply that psychological therapies may change the circadian rhythm, we end up with the theory of circadian plasticity and chronotherapy, for which there is absolutely no proof of effectiveness currently (see the dedicated Chronotherapy section). To summarize, there is currently no proof an entrained person can become freerunning by psychological intervention only without modifying the exposure to zeitgebers. And inversely, none that an individual with non 24 or another circadian rhythm disorder can become entrained or sustain stable phase advances with a psychological intervention only, which is why chronotherapies are not recommended by the AASM guidelines.
</p>

<p>
The circadian rhythm plays an essential biological role: the survival chances of all living creatures are depedent on their synchronization to the external day-night cycle, whether it is to get food or to flee from predators. The core body temperature is majorly modulated by the circadian rhythm, just like most body organs functions. The circadian rhythm is hence a core biological vital sign, just like blood glucose levels or insulin. Psychological factors hence likely have as much influence on the circadian rhythm as they have on diabetes, which is little to none. An analogy would be to ask whether a diabetic individual could control their glucose and insulin blood levels simply by motivation and will (or any kind of psychological therapy). The answer would obviously be no.
</p>

<p>
Hence, there is currently no proof that circadian rhythm disorders can be caused or manipulated through psychological factors.
</p>

<h5>Can circadian rhythm disorders be neurological disorders, or a body disorder?</h5>

<p>
Since circadian rhythm disorders aren't psychologically caused, it must be a neurological disorder, right? Not necessarily, and there are some strong evidence that it's not.
</p>

<p>
First, the circadian rhythm is not solely defined by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus, since there are actually molecular clocks in every organs and cells. Secondly, even if the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17374488" title="pineal gland is cyclically secreting melatonin following the SCN inputs" class="https">pineal gland is cyclically secreting melatonin following the SCN inputs</a> and is hence usually qualified as the "master clock", this is a highly arguable statement since the gastrointestinal tract secretes <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699659/" title="2 orders of magnitude" class="https">2 orders of magnitude</a> (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12395907/" title="at least 400x" class="https">at least 400x</a>!) more melatonin in response to food than the SCN. Thirdly, the SCN is unnecessary for circadian shifting, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12395907/" title="as the effect of light, the strongest zeitgeber, on shifting the circadian rhythm is not impacted by the destruction of the SCN" class="https">as the effect of light, the strongest zeitgeber, on shifting the circadian rhythm is not impacted by the destruction of the SCN</a>, which shows that <a href="https://www.theses.fr/2012STRAJ094" title="the non-visual effect of light on the circadian rhythm is independent from the SCN" class="https">the non-visual effect of light on the circadian rhythm is independent from the SCN</a>. Hence both the pineal gland and the SCN, the two major brain structures related to circadian rhythm modulation, are not required for circadian rhythm modulation and entrainment. Furthermore, chronic sleep deprivation (often caused by circadian rhythm disorders) causes death not through the brain but <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.049" title="through the whole body via the accumulation of ROS in the guts" class="http">through the whole body via the accumulation of ROS in the guts</a> (see the great abstract video or also the <a href="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/why-we-need-sleep-to-live-study" title="Inverse vulgarization article" class="https">Inverse vulgarization article</a>), which <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(20)30555-9.pdf" title="can be rescued using anti-oxydants targeting the guts (through food or gene overexpression), but not when targeting neurons in the brain" class="https">can be rescued using anti-oxydants targeting the guts (through food or gene overexpression), but not when targeting neurons in the brain</a>. It's not for nothing that guts are considered the 2nd brain.
</p>

<p>
Hence, <b>circadian rhythm disorders should more properly be qualified as body disorders</b>, instead of neurological or psychological, as both of the latter conveys a large understatement and misunderstanding of the whole-system interactions underlying circadian rhythm disorders, and focusing on brain structures such as the SCN that are in fact unnecessary for circadian rhythm modulation. There is of course a neurological component to these disorders since light is beyond doubt the strongest zeitgeber and it's captured by the eyes' ipRGC cells which signal is then transmitted through the brain necessarily to the body, but this should not overshadow that both the brain and light are only components of the circadian rhythm, not the whole story and maybe not even a core component.
</p>

<p>
Circadian rhythm disorders bear strong similarities, or even <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6851668/" title="links according to recent findings" class="https">links according to recent findings</a>, with metabolic syndrome disorders such as diabetes. Hence, it is likely safe to think of circadian rhythm disorders in similar terms as diabetes: a body disorder with some neurological component, which is both varying with endogenous but majorly with exogenous (external, environmental) factors.
</p>

<h4>Why do circadian rhythm disorders exist?</h4>

<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DSPD/comments/glz9by/some_of_anthropologys_perspective_on_sleep/" title="Anthropology of sleep" class="https">Anthropology of sleep</a> dates circadian rhythm diversity back to the hunter-gatherers tribes, where it is hypothesized that the various chronotypes allowed to always have someone on guard at any time. This hypothesis seems verified with another study on modern tribes, showing that even nowadays their members have a wide variety of chronotypes, so they have <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2017.0967" title="someone awake at nearly all times to stand guard (only 18 min are left unguarded over 24h)" class="https">someone awake at nearly all times to stand guard (only 18 min are left unguarded over 24h)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Chronotype repartition among the general population is known to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17936039/" title="follow a bell shaped curve" class="https">follow a bell shaped curve</a>, in other words a gaussian distribution, which strongly suggests a random and natural variability. In other words, the repartition is normal (in the mathematical sense), no two individuals have the same chronotype/circadian rhythm, and it's ingrained in our biological code (<a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000659" title="~40% of sleep disorders are inherited" class="https">~40% of sleep disorders are inherited</a>). The repartition is about 30% of morning larks, 40% of night owls and the rest in-between. Circadian rhythm disorders such as DSPD or non-24 are not accounted in these statistics.
</p>

<p>
Hence, it's likely that circadian rhythm disorders are just due to natural diversity with the purpose of increasing the survival chances of a community. Unfortunately, with the modern society expectations <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/31/extreme-night-owls-i-cant-tell-anyone-what-time-i-go-to-bed" title="rooted in agriculture" class="https">rooted in agriculture</a>, chronotypes others than morning larks are at a disadvantage and suffer from <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07420520500545979" title="social jet lag, despite the majority having an intermediate or night owl chronotype" class="https">social jet lag, despite the majority having an intermediate or night owl chronotype</a> (see also <a href="https://carolynschur.com/percentage-of-night-owls-early-birds-and-intermediates-in-the-general-population/" title="here" class="https">here</a>).

<li><b>In our survey, 29% of respondents with CRDs believe they have Non-24.</b> Some may have misunderstood the definition of Non-24. But of the people diagnosed with a CRD by a medical professional, 19% were diagnosed with Non-24. Our sample is biased by self-selection—people with Non-24 are more likely to have major problems with their lives and be more likely to participate in our survey. Still, <b>the results suggest that the prevalence of Non-24 is much higher than is generally recognized.</b></li>
</ul>

<h4>How to explain non-24 to others?</h4>

<p>
Explaining what is non-24 to other people who don't have it, whether they are relatives or acquaintances, can be quite difficult as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightshift/comments/hjmron/sleepshaming/" title="circadian rhythm disturbances are usually not comprehended by typical sleepers" class="https">circadian rhythm disturbances are usually not comprehended by typical sleepers</a>.
</p>

<p>
The best way to explain is your way to explain, and it's your choice whether you want to explain or not. Here is a list of suggestions to build your own explanation if you want to:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Non-24 is like being permanently jet-lagged. My internal timezone changes everyday to an unknown timezone. The change is not constant but chaotic, so it is impossible to accurately predict when to sleep. It affects all aspects of general health and can cause cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, especially when chronically sleep deprived since this disease prevents from sleeping.</li>
<li>Non-24 is like diabetes <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6205949/" title="before the discovery of insulin" class="https">before the discovery of insulin</a>: there is no monitoring tool for the circadian rhythm, and we are not sure what causes these disorders nor how to improve them. Health consequences of unmanaged non-24 are similar to diabetes, leading to cardiovascular diseases such as arrhythmias and even to diabetes and obesity.</li>
<li>I cannot plan when I will awake or asleep.</li>

<h3>Zeitgebers</h3>

<br>

<h4>What is a zeitgeber?</h4>

<p>
Zeitgeber literally means "time giver". <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-540-29678-2_6170" title="A zeitgeber is any periodic signal of about 24h" class="https">A zeitgeber is any periodic signal of about 24h</a>, which the body can pick up and use to get entrained (ie, follow a 24h sleep-wake schedule).
</p>

<p>
Indeed, humans, and all biological systems, have no way to determine exactly the absolute time. Hence, we have biological, chemical and hormonal systems that approximate what can be called a biological clock. But since it's an approximation, it is imperfect: on average, humans follow a <a href="https://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih_sleep_curr-supp.pdf" title="24.2h schedule naturally according to the NIH" class="https">24.2h schedule naturally according to the NIH</a>. The remainder, 0.2h, serves as a margin of error, <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-540-29678-2_6170" title="which is eliminated thanks to external time cues: the zeitgebers" class="https">which is eliminated thanks to external time cues: the zeitgebers</a>. When this margin of error is correctly eliminated, we say that the individual is entrained on a 24h schedule.
</p>

<p>
Hence, zeitgebers are the essential tool we have to modify the circadian rhythm of humans, and hence potentially treat circadian rhythm disorders. When something modify the circadian rhythm, it is a zeitgeber.
</p>

<p>
Humans are biological predetermined to respond more or less intensely to some zeitgebers, which includes the influence on their circadian rhythms. According to the current scientific literature, here is a rough outline of the order of power of zeitgebers on the circadian rhythm:
</p>

<p>
Light (strongest) &gt; melatonin (strong) ~ food (likely strong) &gt;&gt; exercise (weak) ~ social interactions (weak)
</p>

<p>
Light is the strongest zeitgeber by far. Indeed, we have specific photoreceptors, the ipRGC cells, in the eyes which are tailored to react to light to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28656675/" title="both dilate or contract the pupils and to shift the circadian rhythm" class="https">both dilate or contract the pupils and to shift the circadian rhythm</a>. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30700675/" title="Light is undoubtedly the most potent zeitgeber" class="https">Light is undoubtedly the most potent zeitgeber</a>, and hence therapeutic tool for circadian rhythm disorders.
</p>

<p>
Melatonin comes second, as its purpose is to both consolidate sleep (ie, ensure you don't wake up in the second half of your night so you can sleep a full night), and phase advance.
</p>

<p>
Food is still under research but since the digestive tract produces most melatonin in the body by far, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699659/" title="2 orders of magnitude more than the brain" class="https">2 orders of magnitude more than the brain</a>, and also consumes it, food is thus arguably an also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363197" title="very strong zeitgeber" class="https">very strong zeitgeber</a>. Food is thus an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699659/" title="additional source of variation in circadian rhythm" class="https">additional source of variation in circadian rhythm</a>.
</p>

<p>
Other potential zeitgebers such as <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-540-29678-2_6472" title="exercise or social interactions are weak zeitgebers" class="https">exercise or social interactions are weak zeitgebers</a>, and often not timed appropriately (eg, <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/55022-when-is-the-best-time-to-exercise-to-improve-performance" title="exercise is more in phase with the circadian rhythm when done in the evening than the morning" class="https">exercise is more in phase with the circadian rhythm when done in the evening than the morning</a>). Exercise produces circadian rhythm shifts thanks to <a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP279779" title="muscle contraction which modulates the BMAL1 clock gene in the muscle" class="https">muscle contraction which modulates the BMAL1 clock gene in the muscle</a>. The more muscle contraction, the more phase advance is obtained.
</p>

<p>
Since we have multiple clocks throughout the body and down to every cells, we likely need to entrain them all, or at least most of them, for successful robust entrainment. The LiDACMel protocol attempts to do that with a combination of light/dark  therapy, melatonin and food (composition and timing) control.
</p>

<p>
Every zeitgeber can be good (phase advance) or bad (phase delay) depending on the timing. Phase advance means that the circadian rhythm period is shortened, whereas phase delay lengthen it. This time-dependent effect, which is on top of the dose-dependent effect (eg, intensity of light or dosage of melatonin), is summarized in the Phase Response Curve (PRC) of the target treatment.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700675" title="Zeitgebers are double-edged swords" class="https">Zeitgebers are double-edged swords</a>: since <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="PRC is an intrinsic and universal property of all zeitgebers" class="https">PRC is an intrinsic and universal property of all zeitgebers</a>, present <a href="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/johnsonlab/prcatlas/" title="in all animals" class="https">in all animals</a> and even <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="unicellular organisms" class="https">unicellular organisms</a>, this means that when a factor can phase delay, it can also phase advance if exposure happens at another time. For example, if you suspect getting exposed to screens light in the evening phase delays your circadian rhythm, then the same screens light can be used at wake-up to phase advance.
</p>

<p>
The exact appropriate timing for phase advance or phase delaying depends on the treatment, it's not necessarily at wake up for phase advance or at evening for phase delay (eg, for melatonin the PRC is inversed with the light PRC).
</p>

<p>
Here are the simplified PRC curves for light and melatonin effect on humans (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PRC-Light%2BMel.png" title="image" class="https">image</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_response_curve" title="Wikipedia" class="https">Wikipedia</a>):

</p>

<p>
There are in theory <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-540-29678-2_6170" title="two types of zeitgebers" class="https">two types of zeitgebers</a>: the type-0 resetters, which theoretically can reset at the time you target regardless of your current circadian rhythm, versus type-1 resetters, which effect is dependent on the intake/exposure time relatively to your current circadian rhythm. In practice, all zeitgebers (and hence treatments) are type-1 resetters. Hence, <b>it's crucial to time all treatments relatively to your current sleep and wake up times, not the target/wished ones</b>. This is true not only for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542884" title="melatonin" class="https">melatonin</a> (see also <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/95/7/3325/2596406" title="here" class="https">here</a>), but also light therapy and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363197" title="food" class="https">food</a>. It's not specific to treatments for circadian rhythm disorders, in fact there is an <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jpi.12646" title="emerging field of scientific and medical study which is finding that virtually all drugs have a time-dependent effect relative to the circadian rhythm" class="https">emerging field of scientific and medical study which is finding that virtually all drugs have a time-dependent effect relative to the circadian rhythm</a>, such as antibiotics, so in fact all drugs are most efficient when taken relatively to the circadian rhythm. This time-dependent effect of zeitgebers is also what makes <a href="https://srbr.org/of-larks-and-owls-whats-in-a-chronotype/" title="research about them difficult, as it is easy for scientists, working at usual office hours, to miss time-dependent effects" class="https">research about them difficult, as it is easy for scientists, working at usual office hours, to miss time-dependent effects</a>.
</p>

<p>
Is it necessary to use multiple zeitgebers, even if we only have a slightly bigger circadian rhythm than the average, let's say 24.5h? Yes, because not only having multiple zeitgebers allows to have a failsafe in case you miss one of the zeitgebers (eg, forget to take the melatonin pill one day, then at least the light therapy will still help), and also because the body has multiple circadian clocks: the most famous one is the "master clock" in the brain, more formally known as the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9670565" title="photoneuroendocrine system" class="https">photoneuroendocrine system</a>, which consists of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus, which is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17374488" title="photoreceptive" class="https">photoreceptive</a> (respond to the photic signal from the ipRGC cells in the eyes) and communicates with the pineal gland which regulates melatonin (side-note: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17374488" title="only in mammals did the pineal gland lose its photoreceptive capacity" class="https">only in mammals did the pineal gland lose its photoreceptive capacity</a>) , but there are also lots of peripheral clocks in other organs (liver, intestines, muscles) down to every cells (mitochondria are receptive to melatonin). If a zeitgeber entrains one but not the others (such light not entraining the digestive clock), then the body may still continue to freerun because of the mismatch between the various body clocks and hence prevent whole body entrainment.
</p>

<h4>Melatonin</h4>

<p>
Melatonin can both <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389945707003589" title="phase advance the circadian rhythm by binding to the melatonin type 2 (MT2) receptors" class="https">phase advance the circadian rhythm by binding to the melatonin type 2 (MT2) receptors</a>, and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/86/10/4727/2849013" title="consolidate sleep" class="https">consolidate sleep</a> (ie, avoids fragmentation and waking up too early by ensuring the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/86/10/4727/2849013" title="body stays asleep during the 2nd half of the biological night" class="https">body stays asleep during the 2nd half of the biological night</a>).

</p>

<p>
According to the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14715839/" title="latest findings" class="https">latest findings</a>, it is currently theorized that the biological purpose of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2019.00391/full" title="melatonin is to be a circadian rhythm stabilizer" class="https">melatonin is to be a circadian rhythm stabilizer</a>, and not a zeitgeber. This holds true for <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14715839/" title="exogenous melatonin too" class="https">exogenous melatonin too</a>, although it likely depends on the formulation: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699659/" title="instant-release melatonin for circadian rhythm shifting, prolonged-release melatonin for primary insomnia (ie, sleep consolidation)" class="https">instant-release melatonin for circadian rhythm shifting, prolonged-release melatonin for primary insomnia (ie, sleep consolidation)</a>. Hence, it may not be biologically meant to shift the circadian rhythm, although it can be used for this purpose as shown by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/95/7/3325/2596406" title="PRC curve studies" class="https">PRC curve studies</a>.

</p>

<p>
Although it is now known that melatonin is most effective several hours (3-6h) before usual bedtime, contrary to previous medical misconceptions (which often prescribed melatonin 1h before target bedtime), due to inter-individual variability in DLMO and sensitivity to melatonin, there is no way to tell exactly what time and dosage will be ideal for anybody. This means that the best and only way to find the optimal timing and dosage of melatonin for you is by <b>trial-and-error</b>.
</p>

<p>
It's impossible that melatonin doesn't affect you. It's processed by every single cells in your body, and it's a necessary hormone with lots of biological functions apart from circadian rhythm stabilization, without it you would likely be dead.
</p>

<p>
If melatonin does not seem to work for you, there are 3 possible reasons i see for melatonin pills to be ineffective in your case:
</p>

<p>
1- Incorrect formulation: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699659/" title="instant release form likely works better than prolonged release to treat circadian rhythm disorders" class="https">instant release form likely works better than prolonged release to treat circadian rhythm disorders</a>. If unsure, just crush the pills into a powder, this will make it into an instant release form in any case because it's only the coating that can make melatonin into a prolonged release form.
</p>

<p>
2- Wrong timing: intake should be 2-6h before your natural sleep onset, not your target one.
</p>

<p>
3- Bright light exposure after taking melatonin will inhibit melatonin. Even a computer screen at medium or full brightness can inhibit melatonin (because the effect is stronger when you stare at the light source).
</p>

<p>
4- <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5263069/" title="High variability in the quality control of over-the-counter melatonin pills, sometimes with a dosage 5x higher or smaller than what is labelled on the package" class="https">High variability in the quality control of over-the-counter melatonin pills, sometimes with a dosage 5x higher or smaller than what is labelled on the package</a>, even for the same brand and product but between lots. This variability may be the root cause for why some people report too much effect, while others report no effect at all for the same dosage. It may simply be that under the hood they didn't have the same dosage at all. If you experienced too much effect with melatonin, at least this is a good hint this works, so you may try another brand with the same or different dosage to adjust and maybe find a brand with a good enough quality control, or ask a pharmacy to make a preparation in a lab for you. Personally, after trying lots of melatonin formulations including from pharmacies and labs, I found the Valdispert 1.9mg instant release melatonin works well and stably, but I can't guarantee the stability nor purity. Also, a tip as the authors note: "the <b>least variable products were those that contained the simplest mix of ingredients, generally oral or sublingual tablets with melatonin</b> added to a filler of silica or cellulose derivatives and were the most reproducible", which is the case of <a href="http://valdispert.com/products/melatonin/melatonin19/" title="Valdispert 1.9mg instant release melatonin" class="http">Valdispert 1.9mg instant release melatonin</a>, where melatonin is the sole active component (no camomille or other "sleeping inducing natural herbs" stuff).
</p>

<p>
5- Optionally: Reduce/avoid food and sweet drinks after taking melatonin. Some people have a genetic mutation of the melatonin type 2 (MT2) receptor that does weird things when both glucose and melatonin are present in the blood stream.
</p>

<p>
Fwiw, for 10 years i was like that, i thought melatonin had no effect on me, until i recently learned how to use it. It's a quite delicate thing, it only works under specific circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Is melatonin safe for kids? It was used in multiple trials for autistic children, including <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30132686/" title="a long-term one" class="https">a long-term one</a>, and is even commercially available as a medically regulated drug under the name of Circadin or PedPRM, so yes it is safe.

<p>
There is a common minor side-effect at the root of most complaints, and is that melatonin can produce more vivid dreams. More vivid dreams are not necessarily nightmares, but they often are. Hence, melatonin increases the likelihood of experiencing nightmares. Are nightmares bad for the circadian rhythm or sleep? According to a study (the only one on this question, there is surprisingly very few scientists who investigated this question), <a href="https://bpded.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40479-014-0023-4" title="nightmares affect subjective feelings of sleep quality but not sleep quality per se" class="https">nightmares affect subjective feelings of sleep quality but not sleep quality per se</a>, as there is no objective change in the sleep structure whether or not the dream is good or bad. This finding can also be put into perspective with the slightly more extensive research about lucid dreams, which shows that being conscious during dreams does not impact the sleep structure or quality either. So this indicates that the <b>dreams content is irrelevant to the sleep structure or quality</b>. This matches what I observed experimentally, that nightmares do not impact the circadian rhythm nor mood nor energy levels during wakefulness periods, it's rather the sleep duration and timing (relative to the circadian rhythm) that matters.

<h4>Light and dark therapy</h4>

<br>

<h5>Light therapy parameters, Luminette and photic history</h5>

<p>
Light is without a doubt the most powerful tool we have to manipulate the circadian rhythm. Hence, <b>light is the number 1 tool anyone with a (sighted) circadian rhythm disorder needs to try</b>. All other currently available treatments (including melatonin) provide much less circadian shifts than light can (but they can be combined for greater effect).
</p>

<p>
Luminettes aren't really necessary, anything that stimulate your nasal hemiretina should work, but Luminette are more effective, because it is enriched in blue light and has a comfortable form factor (glasses) which guarantee an adequate and invariable distance and angle of the LEDs to adequately stimulate the ipRGC cells. This is why there are anecdotal reports of individuals achieving entrainment with a simple light from a computer screen, a make-up mirror with bright light, and also classical light therapy lamps for Seasonal Affective Disorder such as the Beurer TL30 lamp.
</p>

<p>
Light therapy affects the circadian rhythm by stimulating the ipRGC receptor cells (that are connected to <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11818-019-00215-x" title="S-Cone cells" class="https">S-Cone cells</a>) <a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/76/16/1422" title="in the macula and nasal regions of the retina" class="https">in the macula and nasal regions of the retina</a>. The more these cells are stimulated, the more phase advance and melatonin inhibition will happen. Although the <a href="https://www.theses.fr/2012STRAJ094" title="ipRGC cells relay the light signals to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)" class="https">ipRGC cells relay the light signals to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)</a>, contrary to a common misconception <a href="https://www.theses.fr/2012STRAJ094" title="the SCN is not necessary for the phase advance effect" class="https">the SCN is not necessary for the phase advance effect</a> of light therapy as the effect goes through some unknown biological pathway, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12395907/" title="since the destruction of the SCN does not impair phase advance by light therapy" class="https">since the destruction of the SCN does not impair phase advance by light therapy</a>. Furthermore, although <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30697806" title="ipRGC cells stimulation exquisitively inhibits melatonin" class="https">ipRGC cells stimulation exquisitively inhibits melatonin</a>, phase advance by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29707782/" title="light therapy is decoupled with melatonin" class="https">light therapy is decoupled with melatonin</a>: we can have a big phase advance without significant melatonin inhibition, and inversely (see also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/" title="here" class="https">here</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11818-019-00215-x" title="here" class="https">here</a>). Hence, the goal of an effective light therapy is to optimize the stimulation of a maximum of ipRGC cells.
</p>

In other words, light therapy also allows to sleep earlier (ie, sleep onset), complementing melatonin (and likey through photic history changing melatonin levels, see more below). <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700675" title="Sunlight is rich in blue light" class="https">Sunlight is rich in blue light</a>.
</p>

<p>
Light intensity matters, even more than light color, but with a limited range: the sensitivity bandwidth of the eyes is not the same for visual signals and non-visual signals (ie, circadian rhythm shift): <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3892948/" title="9 to 10 orders of magnitude for visual, whereas it's limited to 2 orders of magnitude for non-visual" class="https">9 to 10 orders of magnitude for visual, whereas it's limited to 2 orders of magnitude for non-visual</a>, hence the saturation point of light intensity is relatively low. Combine this with the fact that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311830" title="circadian rhythm shift and melatonin suppression are achieved with light with an intensity as low as 5-10 lux" class="https">circadian rhythm shift and melatonin suppression are achieved with light with an intensity as low as 5-10 lux</a> (and maybe even <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30697806/" title="lower" class="https">lower</a>). Also, with only <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6928018/" title="100 lux light therapy, this produces half of the circadian shifting effects of a 10K lux light therapy" class="https">100 lux light therapy, this produces half of the circadian shifting effects of a 10K lux light therapy</a>, "including melatonin suppression, circadian phase resetting and the alerting responses" (ie, vigilance boost). All these findings mean that humans are sensitive to light of virtually any intensity and color, and the maximum phase shift is reached with max 1,000 to 10,000 lux, and even below for people with circadian rhythm disorders if they are <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2e24/1cade46b0c7ed28753dbb1685c7e8bfde204.pdf" title="hypersensitive to light as some studies found" class="https">hypersensitive to light as some studies found</a>, so no need to burn your eyes with more intense lights. On the other hand, this also means that any effort to reduce light exposure in the evening is of primary importance (see the section on dark therapy below).
</p>

<p>
However, although all light colors and intensities can shift the circadian rhythm and hence help with entrainment, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12727312/" title="blue light alone is about 185 times more efficient than polychromatic white light." class="https">blue light alone is about 185 times more efficient than polychromatic white light.</a> For stable entrainment, the goal is to oppose the natural daily phase delay of an individual's non-24 circadian rhythm with an equal or greater amount of phase advance, such as by using bright light therapy. Hence, we want to maximize the phase advance to set all chances on our side. To maximize, the goal is to stimulate the ipRGC receptors in the eyes the most, hence there are 2 parameters with subparameters:

<p>
<a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/jphysiol.2010.201194" title="Photic history" class="https">Photic history</a> is a crucial, but complex, phenomenon. This means that prior light exposure affects how the body will react to future light exposure, as well as other indirect changes such as in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5880743/" title="melatonin levels, by stimulation of the ipRGC cells" class="https">melatonin levels, by stimulation of the ipRGC cells</a>. This effect can be both beneficial or detrimental depending on the timing: <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1600-079X.2002.01885.x" title="light therapy in the morning is less effective if an individual is exposed to light in the previous evening or night" class="https">light therapy in the morning is less effective if an individual is exposed to light in the previous evening or night</a>, whereas if the participant is exposed to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27449476" title="blue light only during the biological morning and use dark therapy in the evening, this increases melatonin levels more than other colors while simultaneously phase advancing more than other colors" class="https">blue light only during the biological morning and use dark therapy in the evening, this increases melatonin levels more than other colors while simultaneously phase advancing more than other colors</a>. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700675" title="prior exposure to bright light during the biological day reduces sensitivity to light in the biological evening" class="https">prior exposure to bright light during the biological day reduces sensitivity to light in the biological evening</a>, and inversely prior exposure to only dim light during the day increases the sensitivity to night-time light, which will more easily cause phase delays. To summarize, photic history shows that light therapy in the biological morning not only phase advances, but also 1- makes the participant more robust to insomnia by increasing endogenous melatonin levels and hence indirectly consolidating sleep, 2- reduces the sensitivity to phase delaying lights in the biological evening and hence may reduce the need for dark therapy.
</p>

<p>
Photic history explains why the effect of light therapy snowballs until it reaches its max effect at about the 10th day, because light therapy not only phase advances instantly the circadian rhythm, but also reduces evening light phase delays, so over time the phase advance becomes bigger and bigger. The author is convinced photic history plays a major role in the special effects I have observed with very long light therapy, and that this is a critical parameter to control for optimal therapeutic yields. Indeed, photic history explains the following practical observations:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>why it takes a few days to work: 2 days for the first effects, 10 days to reach maximum phase advance without changing anything during the 10 days, because light therapy is self reinforcing ;</li>
<li>why feeling sleepier at the correct time after light therapy because melatonin levels are increased the biological nights after ;</li>
<li>why a longer exposure increases non linearly the phase advance, because not only the phase advance is linearly increased, but prior light therapy protects against evening light exposure so that sleepiness and melatonin levels will stay at high levels even when exposed to light. This point also explains why non-24 can be reinforced through a vicious cycle of dim lighting in the awake period (which can be inversed with the day-night cycle), which will only reinforce the hypersensitivity to light and hence the circadian misalignment problems. But the opposite is also true, as it can be used to create a virtuous cycle: <b>through photic history, light therapy can make the user less hypersensitive to light</b> (ie, more robust to unwanted phase delays due to bio evening lights).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Is more light intensity always better? Not necessarily, because there is a physiological limit beyond which light intensity doesn't matter because we already reached ipRGC cells max stimulation. This maximum stimulation limit was quantified <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3892948/" title="and is limited to 2 orders of magnitude" class="https">and is limited to 2 orders of magnitude</a> (eg, 100-10000 lux or 10-1000 lux, the exact boundaries of light sensitivity are not known and can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27091519" title="vary from one person to the next" class="https">vary from one person to the next</a>). Since <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12727312/" title="blue light is about 185 times more efficient" class="https">blue light is about 185 times more efficient</a> to stimulate ipRGC cells, it's much easier with blue light to reach the max stimulation of ipRGC cells and hence maximize the phase advance than with white light or other colors. That's why most blue light therapy glasses only use a low lux setting such as 500 lux or max 1500 lux, whereas white light therapy lamps use 10K lux (the reduction in lux also serves as battery saving strategy since 10K lux is too much to run on a battery). Although more light intensity is not always necessary, sufficient light intensity is necessary to stimulate the ipRGC cells sufficiently to get enough phase advance to be entrained. It remains to be seen how little is sufficient for non24 entrainment, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6928018/" title="100 lux light therapy was found to be sufficient to produce half of the circadian shifting effects of 10K lux light therapy" class="https">100 lux light therapy was found to be sufficient to produce half of the circadian shifting effects of 10K lux light therapy</a>. Furthermore consistent entrainment was achieved during the self-experiment with 500 lux. The second subject could stay entrained for months at the time of this writing with only computer screens (but during spring-summer, so might be confounded with sunlight complementary effect). For comparison, computer screens at maximum brightness usually emit about 250 lux.
</p>

<p>
In addition to light intensity, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29707782/" title="the duration of light exposure also proportionally increases the amount of phase advance" class="https">the duration of light exposure also proportionally increases the amount of phase advance</a>, and there is apparently no limit contrary to what was thought before (that light would advance only during a limited timeframe around wake-up, it seems it works for much longer than that). Informally but interestingly, a member of the N24 Discord server, owner of a Beurer TL30, contacted Beurer in 2020 to ask what they would advise to treat circadian rhythm disorders, to which they replied to use the lamp for 4 hours at 1250 lux distance, suggesting they also are aware that long light therapy leads to more phase advance that can help with circadian rhythm disorders, maybe due to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21636952" title="this 2011 study" class="https">this 2011 study</a>.
</p>

<p>
During the author's self-experiment, it was found that lengthening the duration of light therapy was more effective to get additional phase advance in comparison to increasing light intensity, the latter showing no significant benefits but produced minor but uncomfortable side-effects such as dizziness and headaches due to sudden exposure to bright light.
</p>

<p>
The effect of light on the circadian rhythm is not solely due to its inhibition of melatonin, because it was shown that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29707782/" title="intermittent light can phase advance the circadian rhythm without reducing melatonin production, and that a longer light exposure causes more phase advance irrespective of any effect on melatonin" class="https">intermittent light can phase advance the circadian rhythm without reducing melatonin production, and that a longer light exposure causes more phase advance irrespective of any effect on melatonin</a>. Hence, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29707782/" title="melatonin is decoupled from the circadian rhythm" class="https">melatonin is decoupled from the circadian rhythm</a> as shown by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/" title="several" class="https">several</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11818-019-00215-x" title="studies" class="https">studies</a> .
</p>

<p>
Blue light therapy's effects (both on the circadian rhythm and the potential phototoxicity) <a href="https://www.anses.fr/fr/system/files/AP2014SA0253Ra.pdf" title="are dependent on the user's age" class="https">are dependent on the user's age</a>: the eyes lens (cristallin) obscures with age to a yellowish tint which is <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11818-019-00215-x" title="acting as a blue light filter and filters more with age" class="https">acting as a blue light filter and filters more with age</a>, with 60 years olds having an average 2 times blue light filtering as 20 years old, and newborns having no blue light filter. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311830" title="2019 systematic review" class="https">2019 systematic review</a> found that age impairs melatonin endogenous secretion and inhibition by light, but has no effect on the phase advance induced by light therapy. Hence, the light therapy duration or intensity can be adjusted accordingly to the user's age to adjust for the reduced efficiency on melatonin inhibition (ie, brain fog), but the circadian phase advance should not change with age.
</p>

<p>
Although the phase advance effect of light and melatonin is limited, they <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/95/7/3325/2596406" title="are additive" class="https">are additive</a>, so that you can for example get 1h phase advance from melatonin and separately 1h from light therapy, and combining both would give you 2h in theory (in practice it will be less because there is some natural biological variability from day-to-day, but at least by combining multiple therapies you get more leeway to stay entrained despite uncontrollable disturbances).
</p>

<p>
So it is possible to try to use only light therapy alone, it was shown in lots of studies and in systematic reviews to work without needing melatonin, but of course you will get less effect. Expect about 1-2h of phase advance with each treatment alone (see <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29707782/" title="here" class="https">here</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27449476/" title="here" class="https">here</a> for light), and combined the effect is additive (melatonin + light therapy can help you to achieve 2-4h in total).
</p>

<p>
Luminette can be put on top of prescription glasses (personally tested with huge aviator-style glasses), and they use a battery that lasts for 5 days with 1 to 2 uses per day (= 1 to 2h with the 500 lux light intensity setting). Re-timer are also made to fit over prescription glasses (but did not test myself).
</p>

<p>
Can the light therapy glasses work even with eyes closed? Yes:
</p>

<p>
&gt; The eyelid acts as a red-pass filter (Zeitzer et al. 2014) and transmits only approximately 3%–14% of light (Robinson et al. 1991) in a wavelength-dependent manner. Thus, the retinal exposure of light depends on the status of the eyes (open, closed).<br>
&gt; [...] Similarly, Figueiro and Rea (2012) showed how light delivered through eyelids during one hour suppressed melatonin and phase shift DLMO. Both studies suggested that phototherapy may also be given with closed eyes, and even while asleep (Zeitzer et al. 2014).<br>

</p>

<p>
So yes it works, and even <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311830" title="with light as low as 5-10 lux while the eyes are closed" class="https">with light as low as 5-10 lux while the eyes are closed</a>, but has of course much less effect on the circadian rhythm than with the eyes open. Note however that a "<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0269881119855343" title="light mask" class="https">light mask</a>", an experimental light therapy device to be worn during sleeping and emitting light during the last 4 hours of sleep before wake-up, hence with the eyes closed, shown some efficacy in phase advancing individuals with DSPD. It's likely that much longer exposures than usual (as they did with exposing for 4h to the light mask) are necessary to get any benefit from light therapy with the eyes closed.
</p>

<p>
But eyes closing can nevertheless be useful. If the light is blinding you when you switch on the Luminette, close your eyes at first for a few seconds and then open them, your eyes will have accomodated by then and the light won't blind you anymore. This should also avoid the dizziness and headaches that can happen when being suddenly exposed to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6928018/" title="bright light due to sudden increases in cortisol" class="https">bright light due to sudden increases in cortisol</a>. It may also avoid the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26635-7" title="changes in the macula induced by sudden bright light exposure in a dim lit environment" class="https">changes in the macula induced by sudden bright light exposure in a dim lit environment</a>, by gently allowing for pupil contraction, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311830" title="pupil area being correlated with melatonin suppression" class="https">pupil area being correlated with melatonin suppression</a> (TODO: and phototoxicity?). Then, when the eyes are contracted, it's better to open the eyes as soon as possible to get the full circadian shifting effect.
</p>

<p>
Is light therapy dangerous for the eyes, more precisely the macula? According to European Union and FDA regulations, and also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28891192" title="systematic reviews by scholars" class="https">systematic reviews by scholars</a> (see also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28891192" title="here" class="https">here</a>), if the device is filtering UV light and the intensity is not too much, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28891192" title="the user does not have a macular disease" class="https">the user does not have a macular disease</a>, then light therapy should be safe. The goal of this document is not to list all devices, but at least Luminette is validated under the all these regulations. However, the french ANSES considers that <a href="https://www.anses.fr/fr/system/files/AP2014SA0253Ra.pdf" title="blue light phototoxicity starts is between 450-470nm" class="https">blue light phototoxicity starts is between 450-470nm</a> (they include the effects on the circadian rhythm), and Luminette has a peak of blue light at 468nm according to the manufacturer Lucimed. Phototoxicity is difficult to assess, as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11744400/" title="phototoxicity is a combination of factors that do not linearly add up" class="https">phototoxicity is a combination of factors that do not linearly add up</a> so it's not possible currently to give any threshold. Knowing <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/" title="blue light therapy is optimal at 482nm" class="https">blue light therapy is optimal at 482nm</a>, and that preliminary data on mice suggests that the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30496813/" title="480nm does not produce any meaningful eye damage" class="https">480nm does not produce any meaningful eye damage</a> unless genetically modified, then it should be possible to design a theoretically safer blue light therapy glasses enriched at 482nm. Nevertheless, keep in mind that the light therapy devices emit lower light intensity (up to 10K lux) than the sun (up to &gt; 100K lux) by an order of magnitude, and sunlight is rich in blue light, so there is no doubt that light therapy has a lower impact than sunlight on eyes health.
</p>

<p>
However, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26635-7" title="a recent study found that (green) light therapy devices (more precisely the Re-Timer) modified significantly the macula under 7 days of usage" class="https">a recent study found that (green) light therapy devices (more precisely the Re-Timer) modified significantly the macula under 7 days of usage</a>, with only 30 min of bright light exposure per day at wake up. However, the experiment design needs to be considered: the participants were maintained in a room constantly lit under 10 Lux, which is very low (1 lux = light emitted by 1 candle). Hence, this study did not just test the effect of bright light therapy, but more precisely the effect of <b>sudden</b> bright light therapy in a constantly dim environment. This is known to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700675" title="increase the effect of the bright light on the circadian rhythm through photic history" class="https">increase the effect of the bright light on the circadian rhythm through photic history</a>, so increases in eye damages would not be surprising. Furthermore, this design forced the participants to have dilated pupils, which is known to multiply the effects of light. Hence, there needs to be more research to elucidate whether 1- the significant changes that were found are clinically significant (ie, can they lead to diseases or they are just natural body adaptations that are not indicative of any disease), and 2- whether these observed effects are due to pupil dilation, in other words if the user takes some time to adapt their eyes beforehand (eg, by being exposed to a more lit environment or by closing the eyes the first few minutes while under the bright light, to let their pupils contract) these effects would disappear.

If this is not the case, adjust the Luminette by placing the nose rest into the slot."
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, the Luminette also says the following, which in the author's experience seems quite accurate: "How long will it be before I notice the effects ? The “boosting” effect of the Luminette® is almost immediate. After a few sessions, you’ll feel your energy returning and your mood improving. If you are using Luminette to rectify a sleep phase disorder the results will become noticeable between 4 to 5 days."
</p>

<p>
Lastly, there is room for future discoveries on light therapy and circadian rhythm shifting, as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15039146" title="studies on mice identified at least 6 different subtypes of ipRGC cells" class="https">studies on mice identified at least 6 different subtypes of ipRGC cells</a>.

<h5>A cheaper alternative for light therapy</h5>

<p>
If you really are low on money and can't afford the light therapy glasses, I do not advise to buy a light therapy lamp. Sure, there are inexpensive ones available, but there are three major downsides:
</p>

<p>

<li>the cheapest light therapy lamps are not very powerful, they say they emit 10K lux but it's only at point-blank with no range, and with lux approximately decreasing quadratically with the distance, it means that if you are just a few centimeters away from the ideal distance, you will get very low lux (low light intensity).</li>
<li>they are cumbersome to use, you need to stay in front of them for minimum 30 minutes up to several hours, and it's hard to do anything in front given how close you need to stay to the lamp and the angle you need for your eyes to get properly exposed.</li>
<li>the major drawback I think is that it's only one lamp, whereas both of our eyes have ipRGC cells (the photoreceptive cells that shift the circadian rhythm depending on their exposure to light). The more ipRGC cells that are stimulated, the bigger circadian shift that happens. Unfortunately, with only one lamp, if it's set on the side of your peripheral vision, it will only stimulate one eye's ipRGC cells (since they are located in the macula and the nasal part of the retina). Ideally, you would need <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10194647/" title="2 such lamps and adequately placed" class="https">2 such lamps and adequately placed</a>, but at this point light therapy glasses are as much expensive and much more comfortable to use and they stimulate both eyes cells.</li>

<p>
Although there is one review claiming that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11818-019-00215-x" title="optimal light therapy should be angled downward at 15°" class="https">optimal light therapy should be angled downward at 15°</a>, there is no reference and apparently no other proof, since there is no evidence of a dorsal-ventral gradient in ipRGC cells placement in humans (although there is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23954426/" title="for mice" class="https">for mice</a>). In other words, it's best to assume as did <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10194647/" title="the study above" class="https">the study above</a> that light therapy lamps should optimally be placed at eyes level, and in the peripheral vision as to allow for the light beams to optimally reach the ipRGC cells in the nasal-macula area in the retina.
</p>

<p>
An inexpensive and potentially more effective strategy is to use <b>computer screens at their maximal intensity directly at wake-up for 30min to 2h</b>. Not only the distance to the user is similar to a light therapy device (contrary to TV screens which may be too far to get enough lux), but also the user can stare directly at the screen, which light will stimulate the ipRGC cells in the macula of both eyes. Then, the rest of the day, the user can get exposed to natural sunlight to increase the duration of light exposure without any device. In the evening, the screens must be dimmed and blue light filtered to avoid the circadian phase delay effect opposing the circadian phase advance obtained in the morning. Note however that screens may not be sufficient in winter, due to the reduced intensity of natural sunlight, so light therapy glasses are certainly more reliable.
</p>

<p>
To ensure your computer screen is useable as a light therapy device, use a <b>lux meter app on your smartphone</b>, this will use the smartphone's light sensor to measure light intensity. Direct your phone towards your screen set at maximum brightness, and position it at about the same height and distance from the screen as your eyes would be when you use it. This measure will reflect what your eyes will perceive. A screen emitting <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6928018/" title="at least 100 lux should be sufficient to get half of the circadian rhythm shifting obtainable with a 10K lux light therapy device" class="https">at least 100 lux should be sufficient to get half of the circadian rhythm shifting obtainable with a 10K lux light therapy device</a>.
</p>

<p>
Are computer screens safe as light therapy devices? They are made to be stared at, and furthermore they emit relatively low bright light (~250 lux at max brightness on the screens the author could measure), and since they are widely used worldwide, if this was unsafe there would be epidemiological data on diseases caused by screens. Nevertheless, the <a href="https://www.anses.fr/fr/system/files/AP2014SA0253Ra.pdf" title="french ANSES" class="https">french ANSES</a> stated that data was lacking on chronic exposure to cold light emitted from screens, so that it could not conclude about its safety or dangerosity.
</p>

<p>
Is the sunlight sufficient or even better than light therapy lamps as some practicians suggest? Usually, no. For two reasons: sunlight directly at wake-up is inconvenient (because you need to jump out of bed and go outside asap), and it's highly variable and can emit lower lux than a light therapy lamp. Refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lux&oldid=961028420#Illuminance" title="this table" class="https">this table</a>, showing that cloudless sunlight is indeed more intense (~100K lux) than a light therapy lamp (~10K lux), but if the sun is cloudy or if you stay inside your flat then it can actually emit less light (&lt;1K lux). Also, 1-2h of light therapy is better than 20-30min of sunlight. If you can afford to jump out of bed and go get exposed to outside sunlight for 2h then you can do that, but otherwise light therapy is a much more comfortable and reliable way to get exposed to light, because even if you do jump out of your bed everyday to get out asap, on cloudy or worse rainy days, then you will not even get enough lux. The fact that sunlight produces variable lux intensities makes it a very bad tool for therapies because your results will vary uncontrollably from day to day, it's like if you take a drug with a varying dosage everyday, no sane practician would ever suggest to do that. You don't need to trust the table linked above, you can test for yourself by using a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doggoapps.luxlight" title="lux meter app on your smartphone" class="https">lux meter app on your smartphone</a>, this will display the lux you are exposed to (these sensors are linear, hence they should be reliable enough for lux in the range 100-10K). Just like food needs, all humans have "<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154619300646?via%3Dihub" title="spectral diet" class="https">spectral diet</a>" needs that are similar but different for each people, with some people needing more light intensity (lux) just like some people need more vitamins or proteins in their diet. Note: do NOT directly look at the sun because it can damage the eyes otherwise! Even <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s1011-1344(01)00196-8" title="looking at reflections of sunlight in the snow can cause eyes damage" class="https">looking at reflections of sunlight in the snow can cause eyes damage</a>!

<p>
If you want a cheaper alternative, there are the Re-Timer glasses (cost: ~$120), which I did not try. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41105-018-0167-5" title="Re-timer 's green light is sufficient to phase advance" class="https">Re-timer 's green light is sufficient to phase advance</a>, but since it's using <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41105-018-0167-5" title="green light it doesn't increase vigilance" class="https">green light it doesn't increase vigilance</a> so it doesn't change the feeling of subjective sleepiness in the morning, contrary to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0748730416657462" title="blue light which directly reduces sleep inertia and increases vigilance" class="https">blue light which directly reduces sleep inertia and increases vigilance</a>. It was also shown that although green initially suppresses melatonin, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/" title="the effect is not sustained and melatonin levels recover after 90min even if still exposed to green light, contrary to blue light" class="https">the effect is not sustained and melatonin levels recover after 90min even if still exposed to green light, contrary to blue light</a>. Using green light, which is a weird choice because <a href="https://www.psio.com/fr/recherche-lumiere-verte.html" title="green light is more efficient at pain reduction" class="https">green light is more efficient at pain reduction</a> and about 75% less at shifting the circadian rhythm compared to blue light, whereas blue light is optimal for vigilance and circadian rhythm shifting. Currently, only Luminette and Psio make light therapy glasses with completely blue light and hence are the most effective light therapy glasses on the consumer market currently. Also both have several independent studies demonstrating significant phase advance (see their respective websites or google scholar), whereas Re-timer only has one as of 2020.
</p>

<p>
Another light therapy glasses alternative is <a href="https://www.psio.com/fr/recherche-melatonine.html" title="Psio" class="https">Psio</a> (cost: non disclosed publicly). It uses blue light similarly to Luminette (although it's pure blue LEDs, no white light, whereas Luminette uses white light enriched with blue light), but with the difference that the light is pulsed (aka intermittent light therapy). Although <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983136/" title="intermittent light therapy should be as efficient to induce phase advance than bright light therapy, it may produce less melatonin reduction" class="https">intermittent light therapy should be as efficient to induce phase advance than bright light therapy, it may produce less melatonin reduction</a>, hence you would not get the vigilance boost that blue light provides, nor potentially the advantages in increased melatonin levels due to photic history.
</p>

<p>
Can you make your own light therapy device? I would strongly disadvise against. For two reasons: it's difficult to tweak exactly how much lux you will get and you won't get blue light, or if you do, you risk eye damage. Indeed, blue light therapy glasses project light in the <a href="https://www.anses.fr/fr/system/files/AP2014SA0253Ra.pdf" title="range that may produce phototoxicity" class="https">range that may produce phototoxicity</a> (range: 450-470nm), but it's also the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700675" title="same range" class="https">same range</a> (450-490nm, with an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/" title="optimal peak at 482nm" class="https">optimal peak at 482nm</a>) necessary for optimal stimulation of melanopsin receptors. The method found by light therapy devices to avoid eye damage is to add <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28891192" title="a UV and near UV lights filter" class="https">a UV and near UV lights filter</a>. (UV = UV-B and UV-C, near-UV = UV-A, which is up to 400nm). But this does not solve the issue with blue light phototoxicity, so the devices try to be as close to the limits as possible, such as the Luminette which enrich white light with blue light with a 468nm wavelength. Also, reducing the light intensity helps, so it's not surprising that blue light enriched lamps and glasses are calibrated to project lower lux (usually 500 to 1500 lux, compared to 10K white light therapy lamps). The phototoxicity is only an issue if the light source is directly looked at (ie, when the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28891192" title="blue light beams hit the macula" class="https">blue light beams hit the macula</a>, which is what allows central vision), hence another solution is to avoid looking directly at the lamp and placing it in the peripheral vision, as shown in the figure above.
</p>

<p>
Let's say you can make a blue light boosted DIY lamp with the right amount of lux (that you can somewhat measure with smartphone apps). Then you cannot assess as easily if the color spectrum (ie, blue and green light emission) is correct and safe, because light spectrometers cost thousands of dollars, which defeats the purpose of DIY for cost effectiveness. Finally, you would also need to add a UV and near-UV light filter and also a complex blue light filter to let only the 482nm wavelength pass through (which would likely be a quite expensive filter to buy), and hope you're doing it right so that it's not <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s1011-1344(01)00196-8" title="harmful to your eyes" class="https">harmful to your eyes</a>. At this point, if you're worried about safety, it's just much easier and better to buy a certified light therapy device.
</p>

<p>
Finally, to optimally stimulate the ipRGC cells in both eyes, you would need at least 2 lamps. As written <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DSPD/comments/hgehvn/cheap_light_therapy_that_is_effectivesmall_guide/" title="here" class="https">here</a>, one DIY lamp of adequate lux would cost $50 (not including the necessary UV and blue light pass-band filters), for 2 it would be $100. At this point, there's not much advantage in terms of cost to buying a light therapy glasses such as Luminette v3 (229€ brand new, 150€ in second hand) or a Re-Timer (120€), and those devices are already designed to provide the right amount of lux and blue/green colored light to optimally stimulate the cells in both eyes, and their safety is certified. If the added cost is still too much, the Beurer TL30 lamp costs ~35€, for 2 then it costs 70€, which is a cheaper option to DIY. And I know of some people who got effective phase advance and entrainment using a Beurer TL30 daily for several hours so it's effective, you can even mail Beurer to tell you how to optimally use their lamp for circadian rhythm disorders.
</p>

<p>
So in the end, I think DIY is just too easy to mess up, and we already have devices that work and are affordable. If you just want something cheap to try light therapy asap, just either use a computer screen at max brightness, because they are made to be directly looked at so you know it's safe, or buy a Beurer TL30, which is less efficient than light therapy glasses in particular Luminette v3, but it's better than nothing.
</p>

<h5>Dark therapy and blue blocker glasses</h5>

<p>
Dark therapy is the avoidance of light exposure, usually in the evening. Why is this necessary and how important is it? As explained in the Zeitgeber section above, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700675" title="zeitgebers are double-edged swords, anything that can phase advance your circadian rhythm can also phase delay it" class="https">zeitgebers are double-edged swords, anything that can phase advance your circadian rhythm can also phase delay it</a>. Since light therapy is the strongest zeitgeber and hence most helpful treatment, due to its dual effect on circadian shifting and melatonin suppression (which will hide subjective feelings of sleepiness and also increase sleep fragmentation), it can also be the most detrimental factor if your eyes are exposed to light in your biological evening.
</p>

<p>
To quote a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311830" title="2019 systematic review on light therapy" class="https">2019 systematic review on light therapy</a>: "To avoid <b>unwanted changes</b> in the circadian phase or night-time sleep, <b>light exposure</b> in the evening and at night as well as in the morning <b>needs to be controlled</b>, as even the longest wavelengths (631 nm) or intermittent light exposures do induce circadian resetting responses."
</p>

<p>
Of critical importance, the photic history (see section on light therapy above) means that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1600-079X.2002.01885.x" title="light exposure in the previous evening will impair the effectiveness of light therapy in the next morning" class="https">light exposure in the previous evening will impair the effectiveness of light therapy in the next morning</a>, and also decrease melatonin levels on the next days, and not just the evening when the light exposure happened. This is another reason why dark therapy is always necessary if light therapy is to be done properly, because dark therapy directly increases the efficacy of light therapy.
</p>

<p>
It was shown that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27091519" title="people have different sensitivities to light" class="https">people have different sensitivities to light</a>, with some being <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31138694/" title="hypersensitive to light" class="https">hypersensitive to light</a> while <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311830" title="others are hyposensitive" class="https">others are hyposensitive</a>, as some individuals see their melatonin levels suppressed by half with light exposure of an intensity <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31138694" title="as low as 6 lux for the most sensitive individual to 350 lux for the least sensitive" class="https">as low as 6 lux for the most sensitive individual to 350 lux for the least sensitive</a>, hence a "&gt;50-fold difference in sensitivity to evening light across individuals"! <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311830" title="Light hypersensitivity is positively correlated with the pupil area" class="https">Light hypersensitivity is positively correlated with the pupil area</a>, with larger pupils allowing more light to enter the retina and hence more melatonin suppression. This holds even more true for individuals with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542884" title="DSPD" class="https">DSPD</a> (see also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30281150" title="here" class="https">here</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsmc.2016.05.004" title="here" class="https">here</a>) or <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2e24/1cade46b0c7ed28753dbb1685c7e8bfde204.pdf" title="non24" class="https">non24</a> (see also <a href="https://papyrus.bib.umontreal.ca/xmlui/handle/1866/19156?locale-attribute=fr" title="here" class="https">here</a>), which can compound with the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21188265/" title="mistimed intrinsic circadian rhythm with the day-night cycle which makes these individuals more prone to the sensitive parts of the PRC" class="https">mistimed intrinsic circadian rhythm with the day-night cycle which makes these individuals more prone to the sensitive parts of the PRC</a> (ie, the timing when light has more shifting effect on the circadian rhythm).

Furthermore, it is often assumed that hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity is symmetrical: if someone is hypersensitive to light, they are so for both advancing and delaying. But that is not necessarily the case and the PRC can be nonlinear, as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7232967/" title="Czeisler et al hypothesized in the 1980s" class="https">Czeisler et al hypothesized in the 1980s</a> drawing inspiration from the fact that all humans have naturally asymmetrical light PRC, making it possible and easier to phase delay up several hours rather than phase advance only 1h. And indeed, we now know that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4499476/" title="low light intensity light in the evening is sufficient to phase delay" class="https">low light intensity light in the evening is sufficient to phase delay</a>, whereas <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21636952" title="brighter light and longer exposure are needed in the morning to phase advance" class="https">brighter light and longer exposure are needed in the morning to phase advance</a>. Finally and not least, the photic history could potentially be used advantageously to modify light sensitivity, as it was shown that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700675" title="exposure to only dim light in the biological day made the participants hypersensitive to light in their biological night" class="https">exposure to only dim light in the biological day made the participants hypersensitive to light in their biological night</a>, hence it's reasonable to assume that the opposite would be true: if let's say I am hypersensitive to light and this makes me prone to phase delays if exposed to light in my biological evening, an alternative to dark therapy could be to simply use a more intense or longer light therapy in the morning to reduce my light sensitivity. This may explain parts of the reasons why very long light therapy seems to be so effective, by giving some additional protection against phase delays (if true, future studies will find that the phase advance of different durations of light therapy will not be linearly proportional but slightly non-linear).
</p>

<p>
Since <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311830" title="blue light shifts the circadian rhythm the most" class="https">blue light shifts the circadian rhythm the most</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/" title="constantly suppresses melatonin during exposure" class="https">constantly suppresses melatonin during exposure</a>, it is also necessary to filter blue light in particular, using blue color filters or blue blocker glasses. Since <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41105-018-0167-5" title="green light can also phase advance" class="https">green light can also phase advance</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/" title="temporarily suppress melatonin production for 90 min" class="https">temporarily suppress melatonin production for 90 min</a>, green light filtering is also necessary.

</p>

<p>
Since <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28656675/" title="pupil adjustment to light/darkness and circadian rhythm shifting are causally linked, because both are mostly modulated by the ipRGC cells" class="https">pupil adjustment to light/darkness and circadian rhythm shifting are causally linked, because both are mostly modulated by the ipRGC cells</a>, pupil dilation is a sign that the dark therapy is done optimally. In practice, this is known since a long time by astronomers, who use red filtered light to avoid pupils contraction which hinders looking at dim light sources such as stars. In scientific studies, low level light therapy (LLLT) consists of providing light therapy but with red light instead of blue or white light, with the <a href="https://www.psio.com/fr/LLLT.html" title="red LLLT light used as placebo control to measure the efficiency of blue light therapy" class="https">red LLLT light used as placebo control to measure the efficiency of blue light therapy</a>. In other words, if you can't see in the dark, there's likely still a too bright light source in your environment that you need to dim down or replace by something else such as red filtered light. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5880743/" title="Eyes refractive errors such as myopy or emmetropy do not change how the ipRGC cells work" class="https">Eyes refractive errors such as myopy or emmetropy do not change how the ipRGC cells work</a>.
</p>

<p>
To do that, it's possible to install f.lux or another blue light filter app. These apps are effective, but not sufficient, as it's also necessary to dim the screen brightness to the minimum. Indeed, both light intensity and color matters, it's not enough to just filter blue light, or to dim down the light intensity, it's necessary to do both.
</p>

<p>
As indicated by <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11818-019-00215-x" title="this review" class="https">this review</a>:
</p>

<p>
&gt; Smartphone use may delay sleep onset. One factor is the light emitted by their screens, but another may also be its entertaining character or related psychological effects, or both. Using the <b>“night shift” mode</b> of modern smartphones, the colour balance of the screen can be shifted to “warmer” and <b>orangeish colours</b> depleted in short-wavelength light. On a recent iPhone 7, this <b>amounts to a reduction of melanopsin activation by 67%</b> at full display brightness. This might seem like a large reduction at first, though <b>by simply dimming the smartphone to its minimum level,</b> <b>the melanopsin activation can be reduced to less than 1% of the activation at maximum display brightness</b>.
</p>

<p>
And this quote is for smartphones, which have a much lower minimal brightness than computer screens because they need to save power for extended battery duration, and so they try to save on hardware backlight power. In my experience, using a smartphone with the Twilight app for blue filtering and dimming light to the max on the phone and a bit more in the app allows to use the smartphone with little impact on the circadian rhythm or feelings of tiredness. Configured like that, a smartphone is probable safer to use for reading than a book, because the bed lamp you need to light your book can also shift your circadian rhythm.
</p>

<p>
On computers, unfortunately most computer screens do not dim much the backlight or even at all, as they rather use a variable flickering scheme - called Pulse-Width Modulation, so it's preferable to rather use a smartphone or wear blue blocker sunglasses. Indeed, if the screen uses PMW, then it is always backlighted at the maximum intensity it can, but it is simply intermittent so it visually looks like it's dimmed, but your eyes still receive as many photons and hence a PMW screen acts just like a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983136/" title="pulsed light therapy device" class="https">pulsed light therapy device</a>. Thus, if your screen uses PMW, it cannot be used in your biological evening without risking unwanted circadian phase delays and melatonin inhibition (ie, not feeling sleepy). Prefer to use your smartphone, which usually don't use PMW, since it's less effective at reducing battery consumption than really dimming the backlighting. If you plan on buying a new computer, you can check whether it uses PWM by reading <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Why-Pulse-Width-Modulation-PWM-is-such-a-headache.270240.0.html" title="notebookcheck reviews" class="https">notebookcheck reviews</a>.
</p>

<p>
If your screen is not using PMW but cannot dim as much as you would like, some apps such as <a href="https://www.nelsonpires.com/software/dimmer" title="Nelson Pires' Dimmer" class="https">Nelson Pires' Dimmer</a> can be used to add a transparent black window that will mimic a brightness reduction, but it won't actually reduce the backlighting, so the reduction of lux won't be optimal but it will be better than without dimming.
</p>

<p>
A very convenient alternative, instead of installing all these softwares and modifying all your environment's light lamps, is to wear <b>blue blocker SUNglasses</b>.
</p>

<p>
Blue blocker glasses are just a wearable device that allows to do dark therapy while being independent from environmental conditions. Blue blocker glasses are amber/orange glasses filtering blue and green light, without dimming the light. You can use them when you are out at a friend's house for example, or if someone is at your house for a dinner or something, you can still do your dark therapy while keeping the lights on for your guests, or simply to read a book without changing your light (else you need to use a red light bulb, which is inexpensive but makes it hard to read).
</p>

<p>
Blue blocker SUNglasses are just like blue blocker glasses, but in addition they have a transparent black shading layer to dim down light. Hence, they both filter blue light and dim any light source (which includes devices where you can't install a blue filtering app, such as alarm clocks, TV screens, etc).
</p>

<p>
Blue blocker glasses should be used <a href="https://aasm.org/resources/clinicalguidelines/crswd-intrinsic.pdf" title="2-3h before habitual bedtime" class="https">2-3h before habitual bedtime</a> to allow for endogenous melatonin to build up.
</p>

<p>
Here is a DIY blue blocker sunglasses made out of a UVEX Skyper blue blocker glasses, with added 5% black shading/tinting filters for cars windows (one filter outside and one filter outside = 2 in total, 5% means that 95% of light is filtered), simply taped onto the frame:<br>

<p>
And here is what it looks like to look through a blue blocker SUNglasses (so it's also dimming down the light - in practice it can dim down sunlight so much that it looks like it's night, which is perfect):

<img src="./SleepNon24VLiDACMel_files/uvex-blue-blocker-sunglasses-simulation-2.jpg" width="500">
</p>

<p>
Word of caution: not all blue blocker glasses are alike. Most are made for "comfort", to filter the blue light from screens and "reduce eye fatigue". But not from sunlight, which is very different and hence these will be insufficient for any other purpose than filtering screens light (ie, maybe not even sufficient to filter room lamps). Comfort blue blockers are very different from industrial-grade blue blocker glasses, the latter being made (and advertised) to protect from <b>light hazards</b> that can damage the eyes of industrial workers. So if you see blue blocker glasses being advertised as comfort devices, with photos of people in front of their screens, then likely they are not efficiently filtering all of blue and green light. If the glasses are tinted yellow, they are of very low quality, don't choose that, prefer orange/amber glasses. On the opposite, if the glasses are presented as safety wear for industrial workers, they are likely much more filtering.
</p>

<p>
Are "comfort" blue blocker glasses or coating for prescription glasses sufficient? They are at least better than nothing for sure, but <a href="https://www.anses.fr/fr/system/files/AP2014SA0253Ra.pdf" title="according to the french ANSES" class="https">according to the french ANSES</a>, they provide only "very variable" and "weak or inexistent" blue light filtering that "cannot possibly" help to maintain melatonin secretion. They should hence be disadvised.
</p>

<p>
If possible, it is strongly advised to choose blue blocker glasses that provably filters the whole spectrum of blue and green light. To prove the filtering efficiency, it's simple: use a spectrometer behind the glasses under the sunlight. However, spectrometers are quite expensive. But fortunately there are a few tests you can refer to, such as the Blubox review, which shows that both <a href="https://www.blublox.com/blogs/news/spectrum-test-results-for-leading-blue-light-glasses-brands-revealed" title="UVEX (cheap industrial safety props maker) and Blublox (more expensive but filters a bit more) filter most of the blue and green light bands" class="https">UVEX (cheap industrial safety props maker) and Blublox (more expensive but filters a bit more) filter most of the blue and green light bands</a>. <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/eyeglass-stores/3-blue-blockers-put-to-the-test/" title="Consumer Reports" class="https">Consumer Reports</a> concluded that only the UVEX Skyper glasses blocked nearly all of blue light out of 2 other more expensive glasses. There is also this <a href="https://www.jasonlauritzen.com/blue-blockers-compared-and-how-to-make-your-own/" title="other spectrometer review with more brands (and it's also a tutorial on how to make your own DIY blue blocker glasses)" class="https">other spectrometer review with more brands (and it's also a tutorial on how to make your own DIY blue blocker glasses)</a>. Indeed, an <a href="https://www.blublox.com/blogs/news/youre-wearing-the-wrong-blue-light-glasses" title="adequate blue blocker glasses must also blocking green light" class="https">adequate blue blocker glasses must also blocking green light</a> (here's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DSPD/comments/h11xok/followup_from_cured_sufferer/" title="testimony" class="https">testimony</a>). Indeed, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41105-018-0167-5" title="green light can phase advance" class="https">green light can phase advance</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/" title="can temporarily suppress melatonin production temporarily for 90 min" class="https">can temporarily suppress melatonin production temporarily for 90 min</a>, and melatonin suppression prevents the appearance of feelings of sleepiness and decreases sleep quality by increasing sleep  ation. Another thing to consider is how much the blue blocker glasses are covering your eyes: if they don't cover adequately, light coming from the sides can still reach your eyes, and actually most of the ipRGC cells (the ones that shift your circadian rhythm) are located in the nasal region, so light coming from the sides of the eyes are very effective at shifting your circadian rhythm.
</p>

<p>
If you have prescription glasses, you can choose the Uvex S0360X Ultra spec SCT Orange, which very comfortably fit on top of any prescription glasses (tested with large aviator-style prescription glasses) and still covers from all directions of light. The Uvex S0360X Ultra spec SCT Orange uses exactly the same material and hence has the same blue and green light filtering efficiency as the <a href="https://www.blublox.com/blogs/news/spectrum-test-results-for-leading-blue-light-glasses-brands-revealed" title="Uvex Skyper tested here" class="https">Uvex Skyper tested here</a>. Indeed, these two models are the only with SCT-Orange dying (SCT stands for Spectrum Control Technology), as indicated by pages 45-47 of <a href="http://www.honeywellsafety.com/Supplementary/Documents_and_Downloads/4294968060/1033.aspx" title="this document" class="http">this document</a>. All UVEX dyes protect from 99.9% of UV too. UVEX is a brand of <a href="https://safety.honeywell.com/en-us/brands/uvex" title="Honeywell" class="https">Honeywell</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here is a photo of UVEX S0360X:
</p>

<p>
<img src="./SleepNon24VLiDACMel_files/Uvex-S0360X-Ultra-spec-SCT-Orange.jpg" width="400"><br>
Just like the Skyper, this one can be adapted to SUNglasses by adding shading films.
</p>

<p>
In practice, I use 2 pairs of UVEX blue blocker glasses:<br>
<ul>
<li>one with shading film that I use to dim down uncontrollable light sources when there is sunlight or at the office when I work late to dim down the bright neon lights,</li>
<li>and another one without a shading film (so just the blue blocker glasses as-is) that I use in the evening at home to simply filter the blue and green lights.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Since there is currently no commercially available blue blocker sunglasses to my knowledge, you will need to do it yourself. If you wear prescription glasses, an easier solution might be to buy a clip-on shading lenses, that you clip on your prescription glasses, and then fit the UVEX S0360X on top. This should both filter blue and green lights, as well as dim down all light sources. It may also be possible to use the clip-on on the UVEX glasses themselves (but I did not try). However, the clip-on may not be dimming as well as the DIY solution.
</p>

<p>
To test if dark therapy is done right, check if your eyes pupils are dilated just like as if you were in the dark. This test works because <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28656675/" title="it's the same photoreceptive cells in the eye (the ipRGC cells) that are both modulating the pupil's dilation and circadian rhythm shifting in response to light exposure" class="https">it's the same photoreceptive cells in the eye (the ipRGC cells) that are both modulating the pupil's dilation and circadian rhythm shifting in response to light exposure</a>. Hence, if you can see in the dark while using a device or doing an activity, it's ok for dark therapy and it can be used during the 3h before bedtime. Otherwise, if you can't see in the dark, it means some light emitting device needs to be adapted/removed.
</p>

<p>
Transition/progressive/photochromic lenses not adequate because they require UV, hence they work only against direct sunlight (ie, not through a window, and not with artificial light either). Hence they are not adequate.<br>
Alternative for prescription glasses: <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Twinswolf-Lunettes-s%C3%A9curit%C3%A9-Protection-protection/dp/B07LH452HJ" title="laser safety clip on" class="https">laser safety clip on</a> amber glasses, if they filter from 400nm to 550nm then it should be good enough for dark therapy, and they should be certified since it's for laser safety hence you are guaranteed they will filter those wavelength.<br>
If UVEX glasses become unavailable in the future, look for laser safety amber or red glasses filtering from 400nm to 550nm with certification, this should be as efficient if not more than the UVEX glasses, and laser safety glasses will always be available in the future as laser is a generic technology that will always be useful.<br>
Shading films quality can be assessed with their VLT percentage, but for clip-ons it's less standardized, you won't know how much dimming you'll get so it's impossible to say what clip-ons to use exactly. If you want more reliability, use shading films with a defined VLT percentage. If you want a more ergonomic and easy solution, use clip-ons with flip-up so they can easily be put on and flipped up if you want to stop using the shading without removing the clip-on, this will work well on prescription glasses and you can combine with the UVEX S0360X on top. However, clip-ons are incompatible with the UVEX glasses themselves, whether S0360X or Skyper, they are simply too small and misplaced for these big glasses, so the clip-ons not only look weird but they don't dim light from all the peripheral vision. Use clip-ons only on prescription glasses, not on the UVEX glasses. If you want the UVEX glasses to be shaded themselves, use shading films for car windows with 5% VLT and tape them on the UVEX glasses as shown above.

(Side-note: although the idea to make the blue blocker glasses into sunglasses is my own, a previous blog post independently communicated a similar idea, to make "<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/long-fuse-big-bang/201701/cheap-new-wonder-drug" title="amber tinted shaded glasses" class="https">amber tinted shaded glasses</a>" to treat circadian rhythm disorders)

<h4>Eye mask and ear plugs - do not underestimate these tools</h4>

<p>

Since this is a frequent issue in intensive care units in hospitals, where the patients are often bothered for treatments regardless of the time of the day or night, several studies looked into <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30507667" title="potential strategies to reduce the impact of external sleep disturbances" class="https">potential strategies to reduce the impact of external sleep disturbances</a>.
</p>

<p>
The two most efficient strategies seem to involve wearing earplugs (to reduce auditory noise) and an eye mask (to reduce unwanted light exposure). The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31090172" title="combination of both was found to be more effective at improving sleep than any alone" class="https">combination of both was found to be more effective at improving sleep than any alone</a>, and they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29157258" title="increased the amount of deep sleep and hence sleep efficiency" class="https">increased the amount of deep sleep and hence sleep efficiency</a>.

Interestingly, a study found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887528" title="melatonin is more effective to improve ICU patients' sleep than using an eye mask and ear plugs" class="https">melatonin is more effective to improve ICU patients' sleep than using an eye mask and ear plugs</a>, but obviously combining would only be better.
</p>

<p>
Although an earmask and an earplugs can't directly entrain your circadian rhythm, they are essential to avoid disturbances from messing with your sleep and hence your entrainment. Indeed, <b>as a rule of thumb: you can't stay entrained if you are sleep deprived</b>.
</p>

<p>
What eye mask to choose? A silk black eye mask is inexpensive ($10) and very comfortable, use that in most cases. For those who have no curtains whatsoever or who are super sensitive to light and don't mind being less comfortable (or if you are on a road trip for example and you have no way but to be directly exposed to sunlight in the morning), the 3D black eye masks can be better suited, as they are rigid and hence completely opaque, but they are less comfortable and also a bit more expensive (but still very affordable, like $40).
</p>

<p>
Here is a simple silk eye mask:<br>
<img src="./SleepNon24VLiDACMel_files/eyemask.jpg" width="400">
</p>

<p>
Do NOT put cardboard or black plastic behind your window to curtain it, because this will accumulate temperature in the window's glass and ultimately break it! Prefer to use an eye mask or if you really want to curtain your window, you can try a light reflector / windscreen shade reflector, but be warned I did not test this and this may also break your window: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/SILVER-FOLDING-WINDSCREEN-SHADE-REFLECTOR/dp/B004VMORXE" title="https://www.amazon.co.uk/SILVER-FOLDING-WINDSCREEN-SHADE-REFLECTOR/dp/B004VMORXE" class="https">https://www.amazon.co.uk/SILVER-FOLDING-WINDSCREEN-SHADE-REFLECTOR/dp/B004VMORXE</a>
</p>

<p>
What type of ear plugs to choose? There are essentially two types of ear plugs: inner ear plugs and outer ear plugs. The issue with ear plugs is that they need to be comfortable enough to stay the whole duration of your sleep. In my experience, it seems most of the time when an ear plug falls, it's because I unconsciously removed it because of itchy ears.
</p>

<p>
How to avoid itchy ears with ear plugs? Inner ear plugs block the inside of the ear canal and this often causes a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1866818" title="proliferation of bacteria or fungus, which likely produces itchy ears" class="https">proliferation of bacteria or fungus, which likely produces itchy ears</a>. If you don't want itchy ears, then the only way is to avoid that is not put anything in the inner ear. Luckily, that's exactly the purpose of outer earplugs. They are more difficult to handle so you have to learn how to use them, and they reduce a bit less the noise, but they are much more comfortable for sleeping. Plus, if they are in silicon, they are washable with soap and water, so they are reusable for about a week. Just make sure to NOT put the outer ear plugs inside your ears, always keep them mostly on the outside. Examples of outer ear plugs in silicon that I tested: Mack's silicon ear plugs or Medigrade silicon ear plugs.
</p>

<p>
<img src="./SleepNon24VLiDACMel_files/silicon-outer-earplugs.jpg" width="400">
</p>

<p>
Also, if you use outer earplugs, don't worry about accidental events: they don't mask alarms or very loud noises, they just tone down, so you will hear your alarm clock in the morning and hear the siren if there is a fire, it's just so toned down that you can choose to ignore it and go back to sleep if you want to. So the sound is less filtered than with a typical inner ear plug, but the advantage is that they do not get itchy and it's highly comfortable to sleep with outer earplugs compared to inner earplugs.

<h4>Food timing and diet composition (carbs or keto?)</h4>

<p>
If you don't know wheter you are sensitive to carbs, think about whether you experience postprandial sleepiness (fatigue after lunch) after eating pasta and such high carbs food. When i was under the strict keto diet, i rarely if ever experienced that, i could always just resume work just after finishing eating. Indeed, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699659/" title="eating produces melatonin and serotonin" class="https">eating produces melatonin and serotonin</a>, both having an effect on the circadian clock. Indeed, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699659/" title="the digestive tract does produce melatonin after lunch as a &quot;postprandial response&quot;, strongly contributing to postprandial sleepiness" class="https">the digestive tract does produce melatonin after lunch as a "postprandial response", strongly contributing to postprandial sleepiness</a>.

<p>
Furthermore, a vicious cycle can be created, since <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/sleep-newzzz/201601/unlocking-the-sleep-gut-connection" title="the diet composition and timing affects the gut microbiota, which in turns also affects the body/peripherial circadian clocks" class="https">the diet composition and timing affects the gut microbiota, which in turns also affects the body/peripherial circadian clocks</a>., which may even lead to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6851668/" title="Circadian Syndrome" class="https">Circadian Syndrome</a> (new proposed name for the metabolic syndrome diseases such as diabetes and obesity), with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6694156/" title="a causal relationship having been demonstrated in animals" class="https">a causal relationship having been demonstrated in animals</a>. Indeed, it was shown that <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/abs/10.7326/0003-4819-153-7-201010050-00006" title="humans under a calorie restriction diet maintained 55% more fat when sleep deprived" class="https">humans under a calorie restriction diet maintained 55% more fat when sleep deprived</a>, in other words that sleep deprivation can curb the benefits of diet or lifestyle changes.
</p>

<p>
Hence the necessity of timing meals accordingly to the circadian rhythm and carefully design the composition of one's diet, as it appears food is a "<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363197" title="powerful environmental cue with the potential to destroy or restore the synchrony of circadian rhythms in metabolism" class="https">powerful environmental cue with the potential to destroy or restore the synchrony of circadian rhythms in metabolism</a>".

<h3>Other sleep-wake issues and tips</h3>

<br>

<h4>When things go wrong</h4>

<p>
If the therapy works and your circadian rhythm gets entrained, in practice slip ups or external disturbances can still derail your therapy. What should you do then? This section covers some of the common scenarios and how to react optimally:<br>
<ul>
<li>If for some reason you had to discontinue using light therapy for some time, let's say 30 min, can you resume after or should you stop? You can continue, this should have little impact on the light therapy. Indeed, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29707782/" title="pulsed and intermittent light therapy was shown to be as effective" class="https">pulsed and intermittent light therapy was shown to be as effective</a> (if not <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983136/" title="more" class="https">more</a> - see also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6928018/" title="here" class="https">here</a>) than continuous light therapy, although less efficient at inhibiting melatonin. Hence, if you stop for some minutes and resume light therapy after, you can expect to still get the same phase advance, however the effect on vigilance may be reduced, particularly if you experience drowsiness (brain fog) due to melatonin leftovers (aka sleep inertia).</li>
<li>If you wake up 1 or 2h earlier, you can do the light therapy. If wake up earlier than that, wait for the usual time to start the light therapy, don't do at wake-up. If the night was too short and you need to sleep again later in the morning (ie, weird insomnia aka biphasic sleep, see related section), then don't use light therapy in the middle, wait for your last wake up to start the light therapy.</li>
<li>If you wake up later than usual, do the light therapy at wake up and as long as usual, or even longer to compensate. This is to ensure a long enough light exposure (photic history) to prevent biphasic sleep, as waking later reduces the amount of natural light exposure.</li>
<li>What happens when you sleep outside of your biological night (eg too late, naps etc) for several days? If was entrained for at least 10 days, the photic history should keep your wake up time constant for several days. After, or without previous entrainment, your circadian rhythm will revert to its natural freerunning delay. Indeed, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7232967/" title="when the range of entrainment is exceeded, the circadian rhythm reverts back to its natural freerunning period" class="https">when the range of entrainment is exceeded, the circadian rhythm reverts back to its natural freerunning period</a>, and sleeping outside of one's biological night (ie, circadian misalignment) is an instance of exceeding this range.</li>
<li>What if you take melatonin later than you should have? In the author's experiments, it seems this may have a big impact on when you fall asleep, but not the wake up time. You should stay entrained even if you took melatonin later and slept later one or 2 days, but try to take melatonin at your entrained time the next days to go back on track.</li>
<li>What if you slept too late for some reason but still woke up as usual, and hence are sleep deprived? If you feel like you can go back to sleep (and can do so), then it's actually better to go back to sleep if you feel it's needed. It's crucially important to reduce sleep deprivation to stay entrained (by avoiding dopamine buildup causing the "wake maintenance zones", see below), so sleep at long as you need and as early in the day as possible. This will actually help you fall asleep at the usual time this evening, if you take melatonin at the usual time. Do NOT move the melatonin intake time, i found that keeping it constant works best (when you are entrained of course).</li>
<li>What if you did not sleep enough or at the wrong time for a few days? Then it will take a few days of sleep a full night and under your biological time (circadian alignment) to clear up the residual sleep deprivation and brain fog, these won't go away the first day you sleep sufficiently, there is some inertia due to the accumulation of sleep deprivation/debt.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>To nap or not to nap?</h4>

<p>
If you cannot afford to either follow an entrainment therapy, nor free-run, in other words if you need to constraint your sleep and suffer from sleep deprivation, the most healthy strategy seems to be to take long naps (ie, at least one ultradian cycle of 1h30-2h) when you need or can, since <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451994417300172" title="long naps eliminate detrimental cardiovascular and neurologic health issues due to prior sleep deprivation, whereas short naps or no naps do not" class="https">long naps eliminate detrimental cardiovascular and neurologic health issues due to prior sleep deprivation, whereas short naps or no naps do not</a>.
</p>

<p>
Some studies argued that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5136610/" title="long naps may cause sleep inertia (the difficulty to wake up and lower cognitive performance for 10 min to a hour after) and hence short naps should be preferred" class="https">long naps may cause sleep inertia (the difficulty to wake up and lower cognitive performance for 10 min to a hour after) and hence short naps should be preferred</a>, but subsequent studies found that it's rather the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6710480/" title="prior sleep deprivation" class="https">prior sleep deprivation</a> that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30722039" title="exaggerates sleep inertia" class="https">exaggerates sleep inertia</a>, not the nap duration. Indeed, other studies have shown that <a href="https://www.psypost.org/2018/10/sleep-inertia-from-short-naps-linked-to-reduced-connectivity-between-brain-networks-52345" title="short naps can also produce sleep inertia, and furthermore sleep inertia is more frequent when the individual is awakened during a deep sleep stage" class="https">short naps can also produce sleep inertia, and furthermore sleep inertia is more frequent when the individual is awakened during a deep sleep stage</a> (stage 3 or slow wave sleep stage SWS), which can be reduced by using chronobiological alarm clocks (also called "smart alarm clock") such as Sleep As Android. This study also suggests more precisely that to avoid sleep inertia, the strategy should be to avoid waking up in the middle of deep sleep, which happens usually 25 to 30min after falling asleep, hence either shorter naps (less than 25 minutes) or full naps (one ultradian cycle of 1h30) should be preferred.
</p>

<p>
There are at least two kinds of naps: the skippable ones and the irresistible naps. If your issue is with feeling the irresistible urge to sleep, in other words the irresistible naps, this is a normal body coping mechanism to recover from chronic sleep deprivation or other homeostatic dysregulations. Hence, the first thing to do is to eliminate chronic sleep deprivation by sleeping adequately and in phase with the circadian rhythm to avoid circadian misalignment. Then, if naps continue to occur, it is possible to use <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27449476" title="blue light therapy at wake-up to reduce the number of naps" class="https">blue light therapy at wake-up to reduce the number of naps</a>. It can also be used after a nap to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0748730416657462" title="reduce the sleep inertia" class="https">reduce the sleep inertia</a>.
</p>

<p>
What if you have an appointment and can't sleep during your night, should you get a nap or not? Certainly, yes. Whether health-wise or for cognitive performance, keep in mind that <b>some sleep is always better than no sleep</b>.
</p>

<h4>Weird insomnia aka biphasic sleep</h4>

<p>
A phenomenon that is not described formally in the scientific literature but is part of the experience of a lot of individuals with non24 is the random occurrence of "weird insomnia". These insomnia manifest as a premature wake-up, followed by another sleep period a few hours later. Here is what it looks like, on night 8/6:
</p>

<p>
<img src="./SleepNon24VLiDACMel_files/weird-insomnia-example.png" width="200">
</p>

<p>
This particular instance happened during my own self-experiment of entrainment, using light therapy (not long), melatonin, dark therapy and food control. All parameters were unchanged with the previous days and all external factors were controlled as much as possible. There was no difference in subjective feelings of tiredness prior to this night. There was no prior sleep deprivation nor oversleeping for a week. And yet, unexplicably, I prematurely woke up too early, and had to sleep 3-4h later to catch up to get a full night of sleep. This seemingly lack of obvious reason for this insomnia is why it is deemed "weird".
</p>

<p>
This description perfectly fits the definition of biphasic sleep. Biphasic sleep was <a href="https://www.inverse.com/innovation/how-tech-saved-sleep" title="historically considered healthy" class="https">historically considered healthy</a> and recommended by the medical community. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2869.1992.tb00019.x" title="Biphasic sleep can be naturally induced by a too short exposure (10h) to light" class="https">Biphasic sleep can be naturally induced by a too short exposure (10h) to light</a> during the awake period, and eliminated by a longer light exposure (16h). Nowadays however, the medical community rather advise a single continuous sleep period, and this is <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/8967-quit-your-sleep-shaming-america" title="more adequate to fit in current societal norms of office hours for work" class="https">more adequate to fit in current societal norms of office hours for work</a>. Whether biphasic sleep is as healthy as a single continuous sleep period remains unknown since there is a lack of study on that question, but since biphasic sleep can be naturally induced depending on the duration of light exposure, it seems like a natural bodily adaptation mechanism and hence likely serving some biological purpose.
</p>

<p>
Hence, although this remains untested for non24, the "weird insomnia" or biphasic sleep can potentially be treated in two ways:<br>
<ul>
<li>by using <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/86/10/4727/2849013" title="melatonin pills to consolidate the 2nd half of the night" class="https">melatonin pills to consolidate the 2nd half of the night</a>, with likely more efficiency for this purpose with prolonged-release melatonin such as Circadin. This increases the melatonin levels in the bloodstream throughout the night and hence the chances that the person stays asleep.</li>
<li><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2869.1992.tb00019.x" title="by increasing the duration of blue light exposure" class="https">by increasing the duration of blue light exposure</a>, eg either by being exposed longer to natural sunlight, or by using very long light therapy using light therapy glasses or lamps for several hours. The exact mechanism is unknown, but it's known that one of the pathways of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5880743/" title="photic history is by modulating melatonin profiles" class="https">photic history is by modulating melatonin profiles</a>, with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27449476" title="blue light increasing melatonin levels more than other colors" class="https">blue light increasing melatonin levels more than other colors</a>, similarly to taking prolonged release melatonin pills. Indeed, blue light therapy has a paradoxical effect: although it inhibits melatonin during light exposition, prior light exposure increases the amount of produced melatonin the following night, what is named <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11818-019-00215-x" title="photic history" class="https">photic history</a>. The effect is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0748730416657462" title="more pronounced with blue light" class="https">more pronounced with blue light</a> than amber light. However, blue light exposure needs to be properly timed in phase with the circadian PRC curve, otherwise <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27449476" title="it can further increase sleep fragmentation if mistimed" class="https">it can further increase sleep fragmentation if mistimed</a> and hence the propensity of "weird insomnia". Blue light exposure at wake-up should be combined with dark therapy in the biological evening since it was shown that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1600-079X.2002.01885.x" title="light therapy in the morning is less effective if an individual is exposed to light in the previous evening or night" class="https">light therapy in the morning is less effective if an individual is exposed to light in the previous evening or night</a> due to photic history.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Less formally, during the self-experiment, both seemed to help, but very long light exposure combined with melatonin was the most effective compared to 1h light therapy and melatonin or melatonin alone.
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, biphasic sleep could be a potential lead to demonstrate a link between sighted non24 and light hyper or hyposensitivity.
</p>

<p>
This kind of insomnia should not be underestimated, as it happens seemingly randomly, is hard to control, and can make the sleep chaotic for several days after despite following properly the therapies. This can be easily blamed on the participant's behavior despite no evidence this is due to behavior, as it happened in the self-experiment. It would be more advisable to try to increase the light exposure duration and provide prolonged release melatonin.
</p>

<h4>Ultradian cycles and the "gateways to sleep"</h4>

<p>
According to the famous Borbély's model of sleep, sleep is composed of two processes: process C for the circadian rhythm, and process S for sleep pressure (aka homeostatic sleep). Melatonin is most correlated with the process C, and adenosine with process S:<br>
<ul>
<li>The circadian rhythm (process C) is periodic, it doesn't account if you stayed awake for way too long, it's like a 24h clock, it always goes back to 0 periodically no matter if you were awake or asleep (hence why if you stay awake too long at some point you temporarily won't feel sleepy anymore).</li>
<li>Sleep pressure (homeostatic process S) is more like a timer, which tracks how long you stayed awake and continues to build up without any limit as long as you are awake, and if too long it ensures you'll get your necessary sleep as otherwise you die without sleeping.</li>
</ul>
Although these are two different systems, they do <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451994417300068" title="interact with each other" class="https">interact with each other</a> (see also <a href="https://www.theses.fr/2012STRAJ094" title="here" class="https">here</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30882154" title="here" class="https">here</a> and <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/E4cKD9iTWHaE7f3AJ/melatonin-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know" title="here" class="https">here</a> and <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aba0769" title="here" class="https">here</a>). So using a treatment that affects one will also often affect the other (eg, both light therapy and melatonin have been shown to affect both processes). See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3KQ5p8C8FA" title="this video by Thoughty2 for a nice introduction" class="https">this video by Thoughty2 for a nice introduction</a>.
</p>

<p>
Ultradian cycles are any cycle smaller than 24h, hence any cycle shorter than circadian. In sleep science, an ultradian cycle refers to the 1h30-2h blocks of vigilance/sleep cycles. This is of importance to fall asleep, because we feel most sleepy (and hence have more ease to fall asleep) between these blocks.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, there is a gap of about 20-30 min between each ultradian cycle, which is sometimes called the "gateways to sleep". That's why if you feel sleepy but fight the feeling and stay awake, after 20-30min you will feel more awake again for about 1h30. Hence, ultradian cycles can be a great tool to know when you are going to sleep, as if you feel a bit sleepy but it's too early for you to sleep (or you miss the window opportunity), you can calculate that in about 1h30-2h you will get another opportunity to sleep, and prepare on time to be ready for it. Meanwhile you can do something else, as it is better to get up if you can't sleep than staying in bed.
</p>

<p>
Also, ultradian cycles are like a rebounding ball, with a peak in the middle: there is always one ultradian cycle where the gap will be the peak of tiredness. The other ultradian cycles will be associated with less tiredness, whether before because the process S (sleep pressure) is still building, or after because of dopamine accumulation which counteracts the sleep pressure and creates a "forbidden zone of sleep" or more formally the "<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30030487" title="wake maintenance zones" class="https">wake maintenance zones</a>".
</p>

<p>
All these processes lead to an "<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2420557/" title="all or nothing" class="https">all or nothing</a>" access to sleep, a discrete event: either you can sleep now or you can't and need to wait later. Hence why the moments when sleep onset (ie, falling asleep) is possible is dubbed as "sleep gates":
</p>

<p>
"The onset of the nocturnal sleep period (the <b>sleep gate</b>) was found to be a <b>discrete event</b> occurring as an <b>'all or none' phenomenon</b>."
</p>

<p>
This interaction between the processes C, S, dopamine and ultradian cycles explains why if you stay awake past your ideal sleeping time, you will find it more and more difficult to fall asleep, despite the accumulating sleep deprivation and sleep pressure, because of dopamine hiding the feeling of tiredness as more time passes on. That's also why after an all-nighter, you will have a harder time sleeping, despite the obvious sleep deprivation. This dopamine buildup may also be one of the factors causing chaoticity in the sleep patterns after extensive sleep deprivation. Hence why freerunning allows not only to avoid sleep deprivation and be more healthy, but it's also a virtuous cycle where your sleep will stabilize and you'll feel more the natural bedtime tiredness, and hence why it's necessary to freerun before starting any therapy.
</p>

<p>
(TODO: add refs and more infos about forbidden sleep zone, from my post: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/fauke4/forbidden_sleep_zone_dopamine_is_why_the_more/" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/fauke4/forbidden_sleep_zone_dopamine_is_why_the_more/" class="https">https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/fauke4/forbidden_sleep_zone_dopamine_is_why_the_more/</a>)
</p>

<h4>Sleep hygiene</h4>

<p>
Sleep hygiene is not the solution, it cannot get you entrained. But it can still be helpful.
</p>

<p>
Usual sleep hygiene wisdom can of course help you reduce the negative influence of habits or products: avoid caffeine (coffee, energy drinks, tea) 6h at least before bedtime, make your bedroom comfortable, cosy and with a cool temperature, do not stay in bed if you can't sleep under 30min.
</p>

<p>
Just like food restriction is an unhealthy and ineffective strategy for weight loss, sleep restriction strategies are as bad for sleep and will only worsen circadian rhythm disorders. Several common therapies such as sleep restriction (sleep hygiene only), cognitive therapy or meditation relies on requiring <i>"efforts"</i> from the patient over their sleep, which only lead to further chronic sleep deprivation and dopamine buildup (forbidden sleep zone). Some strategies also require believing, a positive mindset, or other subjective capacity rooted in ableism. The LiDACMel therapy does not require any such "effort" from you, and no therapy should do. The only thing required is your <i>commitment</i> to follow the instructions regularly and at the adequate timing for your circadian rhythm. All steps are done when you are naturally awake, without requiring you to wake up or sleep earlier forcefully. A positive mindset is a plus as it allows to stay motivated and committed, but it's not necessary, and I actually was not believing the therapy would work since I had to iterate several times with variating the parameters until it did eventually, despite me not believing if it was even possible to be entrained at all.
</p>

<p>
If you get entrained, you may feel like your days are shorter. This is because you are used to longer days than 24h. It's important then to remember your commitment to improve your sleep by entrainment, and so to <i>put your sleep first</i>: if you still have work to do but you feel tired, then postpone to tomorrow your work and go to sleep asap.
</p>

<p>
Going to bed too early is a waste of time of course, plus it worsen insomnia. If your body is not ready to sleep, laying down in your bed isn't gonna help. So yes don't lose your time like that, do stuff when you're not feeling sleepy. It's not unconventional. Ask any typical sleeper to systematically lay down at noon in their bed because someone else decided this should be the time they should sleep at. They simply will be driven mad by the inability to sleep and the loss of time. Individuals with non-24 and DSPD are the same, it's just at a different time. Nothing unconventional in doing stuff when you are awake.
</p>

<h4>Laziness and willpower</h4>

<p>
People with a circadian rhythm disorder aren't lazy, to the contrary, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DSPD/comments/gplcw9/dspds_arent_lazy_heres_the_proof/" title="they put more efforts into waking up than others" class="https">they put more efforts into waking up than others</a>. Indeed, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3KQ5p8C8FA" title="laziness has nothing to do with the circadian rhythm" class="https">laziness has nothing to do with the circadian rhythm</a>.
</p>

<p>
Since there is not one circadian clock but lots of them <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4677771/" title="throughout the body and down to every cells" class="https">throughout the body and down to every cells</a>, willpower can obviously not change the molecular biology of the circadian processes, just like willpower cannot cure diabetes.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, it's highly controversial whether the mind can modify biology. An often cited example is the placebo effect, but according to a <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003974.pub3/full" title="Cochrane systematic review, placebo only affects subjective feelings" class="https">Cochrane systematic review, placebo only affects subjective feelings</a>, without modifying any objective measure. In other words, placebos can help see things differently (eg, subjectively feel less pain), but not modify how your body works nor cure a disease. The chronic sleep deprivation induced by circadian rhythm disorders is not a subjective feeling: it is a real and highly dangerous health issue that needs adequate treatments.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, it must be noted that diagnosis criteria are sometimes too broad, so that a study found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28364473" title="half of the individuals diagnosed with DSPD did not have any significant circadian misalignment" class="https">half of the individuals diagnosed with DSPD did not have any significant circadian misalignment</a> (in other words: it was mostly due to bad sleep hygiene and hence easily fixable). This only shows that misdiagnosis is a broad issue for circadian rhythm disorders (and lots of other diseases), without disagreeing with the fact that treating circadian misalignment is currently a very difficult (if not impossible) health issue.
</p>

<p>
An excellent example is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23024441" title="the NASA crews monitoring Mars mission" class="https">the NASA crews monitoring Mars mission</a>, where the trained crew was tasked with following a non-24h martian sleep-wake schedule to better monitor the robotic missions, ended up with the crew rebelling and dropping the schedule as they felt it was unbearable, after a single month! This crew was composed of highly trained staff, and the authors praised them for sustaining this "broken" non-24 schedule for a full month. But as the authors state:
</p>

<p>
&gt; The authors attributed this result to the high motivation of the crew, although <b>motivation has limited ability to override circadian and homeostatic regulation of alertness and performance and is, in fact, subject to these influences itself</b>.
</p>

<p>
Hence, the non24 circadian rhythm sleep wake disorder is characterized not only by a freerunning sleeping pattern, but by the fact that it is unpreventable and incontrollable (ie, no obvious and easy to fix cause). Just as any other humans, the circadian rhythm cannot be overriden simply by motivation.
</p>

<p>
This video explains the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2wPs4Bd6mg" title="difference between laziness and tiredness" class="https">difference between laziness and tiredness</a>.
</p>

<h4>Should you use an alarm clock?</h4>

<p>
Alarm clocks are not meant to help with adjusting the circadian rhythm, they only are a way to get up to be on time for appointments. Indeed, they don't prevent your circadian rhythm from freerunning under the hood, as if it was the case, circadian rhythm disorders would not exist since anyone using alarm clocks would be entrained.
</p>

<p>
That's why actually not using an alarm clock is more helpful if you want to get entrained, because then you reduce external factors and also reduce sleep deprivation, which messes up with the circadian rhythm in major ways. But if alarms are necessary because of appointments, then there's nothing to do about it in the short term, and maybe wait for holidays to switch off the alarms and fully dedicate to an entrainment therapy.
</p>

<p>
Also, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27611743" title="wake up time is much more predictive of your circadian rhythm than bedtime" class="https">wake up time is much more predictive of your circadian rhythm than bedtime</a> (see also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15600132" title="here" class="https">here</a>). Hence, with an alarm clock, you are deprived from a very strong indicator to track your sleep and the progress of the entrainment therapy. Indeed, it's possible to wake up at the same time or even earlier regardless of sleep time (whether you slept later or before usual), and in my own experiments, the stability of the wake up time seems to be a strong sign of successful entrainment.
</p>

<p>
Do not wake up earlier with an alarm clock to do the therapies. Although <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27449476" title="one study" class="https">one study</a> on typical sleepers studied a phase advance protocol combining a chronotherapy (using an alarm clock to wake up 1h earlier every 3 days) and light therapy at wake up, in practice I did not find any advantage in using an alarm clock or combining light therapy with a chronotherapy. I would rather advise to just wake up and sleep when you naturally feel inclined to do so, and do the therapies when you are awake. This was the most efficient strategy in my experience, as this gets as much benefits from light therapy, while reducing the potential and unnecessary sleep deprivation induced by alarm clocks and which can hinder the effectiveness of the phase advance produced by the light therapy. In my experience, it is useless to try to force yourself to wake up earlier: either the therapy is working and you will naturally sleep and wake up earlier, or you don't and the therapy is not effective and behavioral interventions won't work.

</p>

<h4>Hormones and women</h4>

<p>
Non-24 is arguably more difficult to treat in (biological) women than in men, as they also have a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2278431/" title="menstrual rhythm in addition to the circadian rhythm" class="https">menstrual rhythm in addition to the circadian rhythm</a>. Indeed, the natural hormonal variations and their impact on both the core body temperature and the circadian rhythm on a menstrual periodic timescale. The body temperature is raised during the luteal phase or under contraceptive pills, and lower during the follicular phase with a similar temperature profile to men. Women taking oral contraceptive experience reduced slow-wave deep sleep. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20469807/" title="Core body temperature and melatonin profiles are unaffected by menstrual phase, but interaction with REM sleep" class="https">Core body temperature and melatonin profiles are unaffected by menstrual phase, but interaction with REM sleep</a>. Hence, "gender, menstrual cycle phase and hormonal contraceptives significantly influence body temperature".
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, "<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311830" title="use of oral contraceptives has been found to increase night-time melatonin levels and the menstrual phase may affect the melatonin level" class="https">use of oral contraceptives has been found to increase night-time melatonin levels and the menstrual phase may affect the melatonin level</a> (Webley and Leidenberger 1986; Wright and Badia 1999)", so there is an interaction between melatonin and contraceptives, including <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3722324/" title="progestin" class="https">progestin</a> which increases melatonin levels.
</p>

<p>
"Continuous monitoring of body temperature during the menstrual cycle is commonly performed in daily life. The <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/abe/7/0/7_7_88/_pdf" title="basal body temperature (BBT) decreases at the end of the luteal phase" class="https">basal body temperature (BBT) decreases at the end of the luteal phase</a>."

Sleep-deprived humans may be more vulnerable to heat loss with reduced ability to warm even at temperatures thought to be associated with thermal comfort."
</p>

<p>
According to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16218077/" title="the 2005 study on the biggest cohort (57 participants) on sighted non-24 subjects" class="https">the 2005 study on the biggest cohort (57 participants) on sighted non-24 subjects</a> yet, there were 41 (72%) men and 16 (28%) women. This high disparity is in contrast with observations that can be made on community support groups such as the N24 discord, where participants introduce themselves, and which allows to observe that gender is much more balanced. Also apriori there is no genetic predisposition that would be specific for male sex. Hence, it is the author's conviction that women are under-diagnosed, even more than men, with circadian rhythm disorders, due to both psychiatric misdiagnosis as a somatic/conversion/anxiety disorder, and because of cultural and societal expectations women are less required to perform work and hence can more easily fit into society by being assigned to home and children care, which makes them and their disorder further invisible.
</p>

<p>
Women higher in progesterone such as during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and men lower in testosterone, both of which can be caused by sleep deprivation, were <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6584637/" title="more vulnerable to emotional swings, showing that sleep deprivation can impact sex hormones which in turns can impair emotional regulation" class="https">more vulnerable to emotional swings, showing that sleep deprivation can impact sex hormones which in turns can impair emotional regulation</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note the author of this present document is male, and hence this section could be further expanded and there may be specific tips and additional therapies or adjustments necessary for the VLiDACMel protocol to optimally work for women. It would also be necessary to find if some studies were done on hormonal replacement therapy and other hormonal treatments, as the induced change in hormones is likely relevant to circadian rhythm disorders.
</p>

<h4>Nightmares and sleep quality</h4>

<p>
Nightmares are a common worry among sufferers of sleep disorders.
</p>

<p>
In my experience, dreams and nightmares are not related to the sleep quality nor the circadian rhythm disorders. Sleep quality is solely determined in the author's case by sleep duration and circadian alignment (ie, sleeping under the low phase of the circadian rhythm). Nightmares were an almost daily occurrence during the whole experiment, and they did not impair the entrainment (nor cause desynchronization). They also did not impact daytime mood, contrary to <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-dreaming-and-what-does-it-tell-us-about-memory-excerpt/" title="what psychologists hypothesized" class="https">what psychologists hypothesized</a>, whereas sleep duration and circadian misalignment did. This decorrelation between nightmares and sleep quality was observed in a study: "<a href="https://bpded.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40479-014-0023-4" title="nightmares affect the experience of sleep quality but not sleep architecture" class="https">nightmares affect the experience of sleep quality but not sleep architecture</a>".
</p>

<p>
However, nightmares can be troublesome for some. Nightmares happen more likely to happen during vivid dreams, and <a href="https://books.google.be/books?id=7Rs5AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92&dq=2+percent+of+dreams+contain+such+memories,+according+to+one+study&ots=N2C6Y6txPf&sig=ACfU3U29XFta3k1qOmC9vOpt2NGuId2FAA&hl=fr#v=onepage&q=2%20percent%20of%20dreams%20contain%20such%20memories%2C%20according%20to%20one%20study&f=false" title="vivid dreams happen during REM sleep, towards the end of the night" class="https">vivid dreams happen during REM sleep, towards the end of the night</a>.
</p>

<p>
There are compounds which are known to increase the vividness of dreams, and hence the likelihood of nightmares, such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9406047/" title="melatonin" class="https">melatonin</a>, magnesium, <a href="https://thesleepdoctor.com/2019/02/12/5-vitamin-deficiencies-that-can-affect-your-sleep/" title="vitamin B6" class="https">vitamin B6</a> (which is often used by lucid dream experimenters as it also <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/high-doses-of-this-vitamin-can-help-you-remember-your-dreams-b6" title="increases dream recall" class="https">increases dream recall</a>) especially when combined <a href="https://searchingsleep.com/zinc-and-b6-affect-dream-recall/" title="with zinc" class="https">with zinc</a> such as in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3d0t46/crazy_dreams_from_taking_zma_should_i_continue/" title="ZMA (zinc magnesium B6) compounds" class="https">ZMA (zinc magnesium B6) compounds</a>. It seems these compounds may be more likely to increase dreams vividness and nightmares occurrences when <a href="https://searchingsleep.com/zinc-and-b6-affect-dream-recall/" title="the dosage is too high" class="https">the dosage is too high</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/68g6m2/does_magnesium_give_anyone_else_nightmares/" title="when taken too close to bedtime" class="https">when taken too close to bedtime</a>, so decreasing the dosage and taking them earlier in the day (ie, the morning rather than the evening) may help.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://restonic.com/blog/eating-bed-nightmares-2346" title="Eating, particularly a heavy meal, just before going to bed" class="https">Eating, particularly a heavy meal, just before going to bed</a> may increase the likelihood of nightmares (studies <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00047" title="here" class="https">here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120115135252/http://www.mta75.org/curriculum/english/effects/eating.html" title="here" class="https">here</a> - this last one is not peer-reviewed). <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1399758/" title="Spicy foods may also disturb sleep" class="https">Spicy foods may also disturb sleep</a>. Hence, it may be preferable to eat earlier, which is advised to avoid the carbs and melatonin interaction anyway. If a meal just before bed is really necessary for you, eating a smaller meal may help in reducing sleep disturbances and nightmares.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the vast majority (98%) of dreams just <a href="https://books.google.be/books?id=7Rs5AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92&dq=2+percent+of+dreams+contain+such+memories,+according+to+one+study&ots=N2C6Y6txPf&sig=ACfU3U29XFta3k1qOmC9vOpt2NGuId2FAA&hl=fr#v=onepage&q=2%20percent%20of%20dreams%20contain%20such%20memories%2C%20according%20to%20one%20study&f=false" title="randomly recombine elements of the waking life" class="https">randomly recombine elements of the waking life</a> (ie, they are <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/06/22/533834764/forget-freud-dreams-replay-everyday-life" title="NOT symbolic representations of the unconscious contrary to Freud's beliefs" class="https">NOT symbolic representations of the unconscious contrary to Freud's beliefs</a>). Dreams content is influenced by the most recent events experienced in the day (see previous ref, mirror <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-dreaming-and-what-does-it-tell-us-about-memory-excerpt/" title="here" class="https">here</a>). Also, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0036017" title="personally significant and novel experiences are more frequently integrated in dreams than common, repetitive daily activities" class="https">personally significant and novel experiences are more frequently integrated in dreams than common, repetitive daily activities</a>. Hence, it is important to have some time to wind down and do pleasurable hobbies before sleeping, and thus avoid stressing or mood depressing activities at the same time. This technique is called <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00221309.1991.9917780" title="positive presleep suggestion" class="https">positive presleep suggestion</a>.
</p>

<p>
Nightmares can be a good indicator of increased REM sleep, and hence of circadian wake up time and potentially of circadian misalignment. Indeed, deep sleep stage is reduced and REM sleep stage is increased when sleeping out of phase (ie, circadian misalignment). REM sleep stage is also increased towards the end of one's sleep. Vivid dreams are more frequent during REM sleep. Hence, having nightmares are more likely to occur towards the end of the night, and when being circadian misaligned. Thus, although waking up after a nightmare is often assumed to be because of the nightmare, it is likely the other way around: that the nightmare occurred because the body was already getting ready to wake up.
</p>

<p>
Hence, experiencing nightmares often signals that the body was ready to wake up. This can be used to confirm that the current wake up time is in phase with the circadian rhythm if the sleep duration is long enough and the wake up time is stable over several days, or if these 2 parameters aren't fulfilled, the time at which the nightmares occur (with or without a wake-up) can indicate when your circadian wake up time is expected by your body, which may be very different from what the individual think their sleep schedule should be. For example, if an individual think their sleep schedule is from 1am to 9am (8h of sleep), but they wake up from nightmares at 5am, this indicates increased REM sleep around 5am, hence the individual may rather have a circadian sleep schedule of 9pm-5am. If the individual can sleep during this window of time for 8h (their natural sleep need), then they found their circadian sleep window. Otherwise, if the sleep duration is much less (eg, &lt;5.5h), then it's likely that the individual is still sleeping out of phase and the increased REM sleep is simply a consequence of circadian misalignment that is not indicative of where the circadian wake up time is, but simply that there is a circadian misalignment.

It's difficult to know which is causing what, whether it's the sleep disorder that causes the other disease, or if the other disease is worsening the sleep disorder, or if they are both independently caused by another third factor but they interact with each others.
</p>

<p>
Regardless, it's known that sleep disorders can worsen other diseases severity, such as autism, depression and ADHD. But there are also anecdotal reports from some individuals that getting treatment for their other disease (such as ADHD) also helped or sometimes cured their sleep disorder, including non24. Furthermore, some individuals were <a href="http://medical-case-reports.imedpub.com/a-case-report-on-delayed-sleep-phase-disorder-in-an-adolescent-misdiagnosisand-symptom-overlap-with-mood-disorder-and-attention-de.php?aid=9988" title="misdiagnosed with ADHD when they really had DSPD" class="http">misdiagnosed with ADHD when they really had DSPD</a>.

Entrainment, or simply light exposure, can objectively improve the situation, and <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/29458698" title="treating sleep issues can reduce the severity of depression" class="https">treating sleep issues can reduce the severity of depression</a> along the way.

</p>

<p>
On the other hand, depression can impair the individual's motivation and ability to stay committed to a treatment (therapeutic compliance), so although there is no evidence that treating depression can treat a comorbid circadian rhythm disorder, the mood and motivation improvement can indirectly help by improving compliance.

<h3>Can this therapy cure non24 and other circadian rhythm disorders?</h3>

<p>
Curing an illness means that after some period, treatment can be discontinued without the loss of the benefits. Management means that the detrimental effects of an illness can be reduced or even eliminated as long as the treatment is continued.
</p>

<p>
Currently, there is no known therapy that can cure non24. Indeed, it was shown that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27449476/" title="the circadian rhythm and melatonin profiles shifts back to its natural state only a couple of days after stopping light therapy" class="https">the circadian rhythm and melatonin profiles shifts back to its natural state only a couple of days after stopping light therapy</a> that was administered for a week and sometimes as fast as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311830" title="under 15 min of stopping light therapy" class="https">under 15 min of stopping light therapy</a>. Similar return to baseline levels over a couple of days were observed with <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14715839/" title="melatonin treatments" class="https">melatonin treatments</a>. Light therapy and melatonin being the most effective tools currently known to shift the circadian rhythm, this strongly suggests that no currently available treatment can permanently modify the circadian rhythm.
</p>

<p>
Hence, the only currently known treatments, when they work for the individual, which is not guaranteed for everyone, are only managing the disorder, not curing it. The treatments must hence be continued life-long to maintain the benefits.

</ul>
</p>

<p>
And here is the list of previous therapies I have tried myself but which failed to entrain on at least 1 month:<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>melatonin only, 1h before bedtime or 2-4h before DLMO, this was advised by sleep specialists.</li>
<li>light therapy lamp (medical grade, brand Beurer TL 30, for 30 minutes at the appropriate distance) + dark therapy (blue light filters, blue blocker glasses) + melatonin 1h before target bedtime, this was advised by sleep specialists. Note that recently a user could apparently get entrained with a very long light therapy (at least 3h) with a Beurer TL 30. So these lamps may work as well as the light therapy glasses, but they are just much more cumbersome.</li>
<li>strict ketogenic diet only (+ dark therapy).</li>
<li>full carbs diet only (+ dark therapy).</li>
<li>intermittent fasting (or even complete fasting for a few days), with and without dark therapy.</li>
<li>time-restricted feeding with big meal timing (with carbs), with and without melatonin 2-4h before DLMO.</li>
<li>serotonin via 5-HTP, either in instant release in the evening to help to sleep, or in long release form in the morning to level up the fluctuation in energy levels.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h4>Other drug-based therapies</h4>

<p>
Other therapies and drugs exist to treat non-24: ramelteon, tasimelteon (costs $17K a month!) and agomelatine. But the data on effectiveness remains sparse, even more than for melatonin.
</p>

<p>
Given how Tasimelteon/Hetlioz binds with a high affinity to the MT2 receptor compared to MT1, and MT2 being the receptor most often associated with circadian shifts, it's I think safe to say it's a unique drug compared to others and it should work for both blind and sighted individuals. It's also the only drug out of circadian rhythm shifters that also improves cognitive abilities, whereas others either do not modify or even worsen them (because they bind to MT1 which is a drowsiness inducer).
</p>

<p>
&gt; Agomelatine binds to MT1 and MT2 receptors with approximately equal affinity and is distinctive in that it has additional antagonist properties at the serotonin receptor subtype (5-HT2c).40 Ramelteon exhibits a 10-fold greater affinity for MT1 than MT2,59 and prolonged-release melatonin exhibits an 8-fold greater affinity for MT1 than MT2.39 Tasimelteon is the only one of these four compounds that shows a greater affinity for MT2 than MT1, with the difference being 4-fold.58<br>
&gt; [...] Two of these compounds, ramelteon and tasimelteon, are approved by the FDA and available commercially in the United States, and three compounds—agomelatine, prolonged-release melatonin, and tasimelteon—are approved by the European Medicines Agency and are commercially available in Europe.<br>
From: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5108473/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5108473/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5108473/</a>
</p>

<p>
According to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699659/" title="this review" class="https">this review</a>, agomelatin should only be considered when the patient has both a circadian rhythm disorder and major depression, as it can treat both. Both melatonin and ramelteon were shown to be non mutagenic and non carcinogenic.
</p>

<p>
But that's in theory, whether it's in practice more effective than melatonin (which is MUCH cheaper, remember Hetlioz/tasimelteon costs <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/05/04/sleep-drug-blind-advertising/" title="$12K" class="https">$12K</a> to <a href="https://www.drugs.com/price-guide/hetlioz" title="$17K" class="https">$17K</a> a month!) <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5156320/" title="remains to be seen" class="https">remains to be seen</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25620196/" title="Modafinil" class="https">Modafinil</a>, a wakefulness promoting agent, was used in combination with light therapy and melatonin to force entrainment for an individual with sighted non-24.
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind it is highly unlikely there will be much research and further clinical validation to light therapy and melatonin than what we have now, because the pharmaceutical industries aren't interested in unpatentable treatments, as they shown again lately with the remdesivir for COVID-19 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/29/gilead-sciences-remdesivir-cost-coronavirus/" title="sold at $3120" class="https">sold at $3120</a> for one course of treatment when its <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32405423/" title="production costs only $0.93 per day of treatment" class="https">production costs only $0.93 per day of treatment</a>. and despite very low R&amp;D cost of $1.5M and public uproar when Gilead, the manufacturer, tried to pass the repurposing for COVID-19 as an orphan disease, which allows for state funding and allows to sell drugs at virtually any price (usually ludicrously high), similarly to Hetlioz/tasimelteon.
</p>

<p>
The only systematic protocol for entrainment ever published seems to be the one by Czeisler et al, using microdoses of melatonin at a fixed time, everyday. The idea is that at some point, the freerunning circadian rhythm will fall in place with the appropriate timing for entrainment relative to the DLMO. Hence, this protocol does not require the assessment of DLMO using salivatory samples or any other monitoring, it simply requires patience and patient's compliance to the treatment, because forgetting the dose or changing the intake timing can render the treatment ineffective. In theory, this should work very well and they demonstrated it worked on several non-24 patients. However, in the current document's author's experience, melatonin is not sufficient for some individuals. Furthermore, the treatment would not be robust, since it would rely on a single treatment and missing one dose would make it ineffective, hence it's a too fragile entrainment for a non24 patient to continue their everyday activities under this treatment. Finally, it also temporarily increases the risk of glucose malconsumption and of developing metabolic syndrome diseases, because of the exogenous melatonin intake during the awake period, until the individual's freerunning circadian rhythm falls in phase with the melatonin treatment. It's also arguable whether such low doses of melatonin, and only using melatonin, would be enough to produce enough phase advance for severe cases of non-24 with extended circadian periods (eg, longer than 25h).
</p>

<h4>Chronotherapy and behavioral therapies</h4>

<p>
A chronotherapy is a behavioral therapy consisting of requiring the participant to go to bed and wake up at precise times. Although a handful of studies shown some phase advance and phase delaying effects, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27449476" title="they are all confounded by the change in light exposure" class="https">they are all confounded by the change in light exposure</a>, and the AASM hence concluded in 2015 that <a href="https://aasm.org/resources/clinicalguidelines/crswd-intrinsic.pdf" title="there is no evidence of effectiveness" class="https">there is no evidence of effectiveness</a> to treat circadian rhythm disorders with chronotherapy alone.
</p>

<p>
The <i>circadian plasticity theory</i>, which is the hypothesis that behavioral interventions can increase or reduce the duration of the circadian period, stems from only <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1435929/" title="a handful of 1980s case studies" class="https">a handful of 1980s case studies</a> claiming that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6622881/" title="a few individuals" class="https">a few individuals</a> with DSPD turned into non24 after stress and amalgamating this as a behavioral chronotherapy. Note also that this study, the foundational case for most claims that DSPD can turn into non24, assumes the unproven hypothesis that non24 is a psychological disorder that can be solely caused by stress instead of a biological one.
</p>

<p>
These cases may as well have been simple misdiagnoses from the get go, which is certainly not uncommon for circadian rhythm disorders, or any disease <a href="http://frontierpsychiatrist.co.uk/the-rosenhan-experiment-examined/" title="when psychology is involved" class="http">when psychology is involved</a>, and actually has already been observed for at least one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16292119" title="sighted non24 misdiagnosed as a conversion syndrome (aka hysteria or &quot;stress&quot;) who was finally correctly treated with melatonin" class="https">sighted non24 misdiagnosed as a conversion syndrome (aka hysteria or "stress") who was finally correctly treated with melatonin</a>.

Historically, <a href="http://www.richardwebster.net/freudandhysteria.html" title="epilepsy was also diagnosed by psychologists as a conversion syndrome / hysteria" class="http">epilepsy was also diagnosed by psychologists as a conversion syndrome / hysteria</a>, which obviously did not help and dangerously delayed the appropriate treatment, since <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC320690/" title="untreated epilepsy can cause death" class="https">untreated epilepsy can cause death</a>.

</p>

<p>
On the other hand, there is no evidence at all of any individual with non24 getting entrained for a reasonably long period of time with a chronotherapy alone. More anecdotally but still of importance, i think nearly all individuals with a circadian rhythm disorder tried to force themselves to a 24h schedule at some point in their life, and the fact they are still participating in online communities such as Reddit looking for a proper treatment only shows these attempts unfortunately failed. Furthermore, the AASM stated in <a href="https://aasm.org/resources/clinicalguidelines/crswd-intrinsic.pdf" title="its guidelines" class="https">its guidelines</a> that only indirect evidence exists, so chronotherapy (or Prescribed Sleep-Wake Scheduling as they call it) is at this point only a "potential therapeutic intervention" with no direct evidence it works, it's only theoretical. This also includes CBT-i (cognitive behavioral intervention for insomnia), which can be seen as a kind of structured chronotherapy or sleep hygiene. Also, it was shown that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25845891" title="night owl chronotypes had less benefits from CBT-i interventions" class="https">night owl chronotypes had less benefits from CBT-i interventions</a>, hence it's arguable whether DSPD and non24 can get any benefit at all.
</p>

<p>
While there is no evidence chronotherapy/sleep hygiene can shift or entrain the circadian rhythm, there is in fact some evidence of the opposite, that it doesn't work, but it's the change in the timing of light exposure that shifts the circadian rhythm, as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311830" title="the authors of this study state" class="https">the authors of this study state</a>: "The study showed that the direction of circadian phase change is determined by the light-dark exposure, not by the fixed sleep schedule, and that both morning and evening light exposures need to be controlled to shift circadian phase."
</p>

<p>
In my experience, i have tried several chronotherapy schemes, including with light therapy. I could never reduce or increase the period, whatever i did. Keep in mind I tried various schemes ranging from the flexible to the extremely rigorous (to give you an idea: I eat everyday the same meal with the same composition and similar quantity everyday and properly timed according to my circadian rhythm since a year now to factor out diet composition and timing as a confounder), so sleep hygiene or rigor was certainly not an issue. There is only one exception being the strict ketogenic diet which multiplied my daily phase delay by 2 (ie, my daily phase delay was 1h instead of 30min), but this is not a chronotherapy and the biological changes induced by this diet are way beyond what a behavioral intervention can achieve.
</p>

<p>
Not only chronotherapy have never shown any effectiveness to treat circadian rhythm disorders, but they are also dangerous because they cause <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4677771/" title="circadian misalignment" class="https">circadian misalignment</a>: forcing someone to be awake and eat at times when their body should naturally be asleep can cause metabolic disorders (themselves potentially causing life-threatening cardiovascular diseases such as strokes over the long-term), partly due to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26868293" title="inducing them to eat when endogenous melatonin levels are still elevated" class="https">inducing them to eat when endogenous melatonin levels are still elevated</a>. In fact, the link between metabolic disorders and circadian misalignment is so strong that some researchers suggest to change the name of these diseases to "<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6851668/" title="circadian syndrome" class="https">circadian syndrome</a>".
</p>

<p>
You may still want to try your own chronotherapy, after all you don't risk much in the short term (if not done for longer than 1-2 months) apart from the sleep deprivation you likely already experience as otherwise you wouldn't pursue a way to fix your circadian rhythm. Indeed, either the chronotherapy works and hence even if it goes wrong (ie, increase your phase delay instead of reducing it), you'll know you'll have a leverage to manipulate your circadian rhythm. The idea is that if you can't entrain, you can try to at least find treatments that can modify your phase delay: if you have some treatments that can make it shorter, use it to extend the periods you like, whereas if other treatments make it longer (ie, your daily phase delay is increased, you sleep/wake up later), then use them to skip through the periods you dislike (eg, night walking). Either it doesn't work (as I am unfortunately strongly convinced), and then anyway whatever behavioral intervention you can do won't modify your circadian rhythm a bit, so you'll just have to deal with the temporarily increased sleep deprivation you experienced.
</p>

If you have a hard time understanding (or making others understand) why the circadian rhythm is unlikely to be manipulable through sheer willpower, you can make an analogy with diabetes: noone wants to be diabetic, and if diabetics could become non-diabetic just by willpower, they certainly all would just do that. Circadian rhythms are the same, they are mostly set in our biological code throughout the body, starting from the DNA and with some potential environmental changes (this is NOT the same as behavioral changes, see epigenetics). This analogy with diabetes may actually be quite accurate seeing how many evidences accumulate linking the two (and other metabolic syndromes, see the Diet subsection in Troubleshooting).

<h3>Core body temperature monitoring</h3>

<p>
Work-in-progress section, will be expanded and rewritten in the future.
</p>

<p>
Core body temperature monitoring:<br>
<ul>
<li>Only the rectal temperature is both non-invasive and medical-grade (reflecting core body temperature accurately), although deep sensing wearables such as zero-heat-flux and dual-heat-flux may become good alternatives in the future: <a href="https://www.gssiweb.org/en/sports-science-exchange/Article/monitoring-internal-body-temperature#articleTopic_3" title="https://www.gssiweb.org/en/sports-science-exchange/Article/monitoring-internal-body-temperature#articleTopic_3" class="https">https://www.gssiweb.org/en/sports-science-exchange/Article/monitoring-internal-body-temperature#articleTopic_3</a></li>
<li>Another review showing infrared and oral temperatures are not reliable: <a href="https://journals.lww.com/nursing/Fulltext/2010/12000/Which_core_body_temperature_measurement_method_is.7.aspx" title="https://journals.lww.com/nursing/Fulltext/2010/12000/Which_core_body_temperature_measurement_method_is.7.aspx" class="https">https://journals.lww.com/nursing/Fulltext/2010/12000/Which_core_body_temperature_measurement_method_is.7.aspx</a></li>
<li>Digital thermometer in the axillary is a good relative predictor of core body temperature: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2010.11.003" title="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2010.11.003" class="https">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2010.11.003</a></li>
<li>«In an individual with DSWPD (B), DLMO occurs later than in a normal sleeper (A) and is potentially influenced by hypersensitivity to evening light, increased evening light exposure, and decreased morning light exposure. A delay in the phase of the circadian pacemaker and sleep-wake timing has been reported in patients with DSWPD, manifesting as a longer interval between CBTmin and sleep offset time, compared with normal sleepers (A). [...]  <b>In healthy sleepers, the temperature minimum during sleep occurs ~2 hours before sleep offset, whereas in DSWPD the temperature minimum has been reported to occur ~4 hours before sleep offset</b>.» <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsmc.2016.05.004" title="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsmc.2016.05.004" class="https">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsmc.2016.05.004</a></li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>
CBTmin is often assessed in circadian rhythm disorders study to quantify the circadian period tau. <a href="https://aasm.org/resources/clinicalguidelines/crswd-intrinsic.pdf" title="https://aasm.org/resources/clinicalguidelines/crswd-intrinsic.pdf" class="https">https://aasm.org/resources/clinicalguidelines/crswd-intrinsic.pdf</a>
</p>

<p>
Links between core body temperature and circadian rhythm:<br>
<ul>
<li>Review to understand the technologies available for temperature monitoring, but don't trust what is said about specific devices, most are dead or not medically validated: <b>Current Developments in Wearable Thermometers, 2018</b> <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/abe/7/0/7_7_88/_pdf" title="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/abe/7/0/7_7_88/_pdf" class="https">https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/abe/7/0/7_7_88/_pdf</a></li>
</ul>
&gt; Body temperature can be divided into core and skin surface temperature (Fig. 1). Mammals, including humans, are homoeothermic; i.e., they require an almost constant internal body temperature. Core temperature is defined as the temperature of the hypothalamus, which is the regulatory center of the body.<br>
&gt; The core temperature is regulated by the thermoregulatory system with its center being the hypothalamus. By means of vasomotor, sweat and evaporation, this system is capable of maintaining the core temperature within a narrow range. <b>Fluctuation of the core temperature obeys the circadian rhythm and shows the lowest value in the early morning and a peak in the afternoon or early evening with a difference about 1°C</b>.<br>
<ul>
<li>Evaluation of wireless determination of skin temperature using iButtons, 2006</li>
</ul>
&gt; the core temperature rhythm has been shown to result mostly from the circadian rhythm in heat loss, and to a lesser extent from changes in heat production [12].<br>
In other words, it seems most of the core body temperature variations are due to the circadian rhythm.

<p>
Apps ideas:<br>
<ul>
<li>blue light booster in the morning and blue light filter (gamma curves) + dimmer in the evening. Similar idea to flux but with 3 modes: blue boosting, no change and evening filtering. Would allow to do a kind of light therapy using only screen computers (only for screens without PMW).</li>
<li>smartphone apps to record light sensor + gps position automatically. Anonymize gps position by allowing user to set named areas, and only the named area will be recorded (eg, at work, commuting, home, shopping, hanging out, etc). Would be a cheap way to record large scale data for spectral diet of humans.</li>

<h2>Ethics</h2>

<p>
This document is the result of an extensive literature review and a self-experiment.

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>
The author would like to thank Dialectical_Warhead for his extremely helpful critical feedback, which contributed notably in clarifying some of the optimal parameters for light therapy.<br>
The author is grateful to the members of the subreddit r/N24 and the members of its relative discord for their support, questions and sharing their experience with this disorder.<br>
The author is admirable of the giants on which he relied to design this protocol, such as Charles A. Czeisler and Josephine Arendt. Since the scientific method proceeds under a longer timeframe than pragmatic considerations, researchers sometimes regretfully feel like their work is remote from reality. This protocol demonstrates an instance of a pragmatic application that would have been impossible without the various and varied work of numerous researchers.<br>
Finally, the author would like to especially thank his significant other: thank you for your support all along, your wise and clever advices, and your continuous help which made these experiments easier with minimal external disturbances. You made this all possible. And to my future children, who were my strongest motivation, I hope you will never have to suffer through what I had to.
